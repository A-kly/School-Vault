## CPU
- Cpu has large cache in order to hide the slowness of dRAM
- SIMD - CPU has some of these, but not a lot, used for ALU add for example
## GPU
- GPU has smaller cache but way more registers, so we can move faster
- More SIMD to process more data per instruction

- Box 3 is SIMD unit 
	- SIMD = Single instruction multiple data
- PU = Processing unit.
	- Essentially a core
