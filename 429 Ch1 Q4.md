Based on the graph generated from the CPI function:
$$CPI = CPI_{Loads} + CPI_{Branches} + CPI_{Cache}$$
$$ = 1.0+0.03+0.36+0.05n$$
$$ = 1.39 +0.05n$$
We can see that, as **n** varies from 20 to 500, the Cache CPI slowly begins to dominate the total CPI and therefore, we can reasonably conclude that this would lead to a "memory wall".
