# Search Engines and Term-Document Incidence Matrix
- Our goal today is to understand how documents (and queries) are pre-processed by the IR system
	- What are documents? What are the choices? Does it matter?
	- How is the content of the documents (and queries) processed?
	- What are the "terms"? What are the choices? Does it matter?
- **Question: why do we have aquarium in the matrix even if some documents have Aquariums ?**
	- The matrix term is in the singular and in lower case.

# Documents
## What is a document (from lecture 1)
![[Lecture 01 - Foundations#Documents]]
## Why does it matter?
- Reason #1 -- scoring
	- Number of words can affect scoring of document
	- terms rare in whole book may be common on certain page of book
- Reason #2 -- showing results to users
	- size of doc matters to user
	- page of book or whole book?

## How are documents encoded?
- Documents are digital files... the IR system must be able to read them.
	- Ex: this is what a digital (hexadecimal) "file" looks like:
```

```
- What words are in it?
- What language is it in?
- IR systems need to know that! 
	- Assuming that the previous "file" was encoded in UTF-8, its content would be:
```
Digital documents that are the input to an indexing process are typically
bytes in a file or on a web server. The first step of processing is to convertthis byte sequence into a linear sequence of characters. For the case of plainEnglish text in ASCII encoding, this is trivial. But often things getmuch more complex.
```
- What if the system did not know that the encoding was UTF-8?
	- we guess encoding
		- try several, look for valid/real words
## Metadata
- Files come with metadata
- It tells us the language and encoding of the document
- Well built websites using good tools will provide this info to crawlers
- not always the case
- Http header example:
	- ![[Pasted image 20240116124732.png]]
## File formats
- formats can have more info that the text we see
### Example: Html tags
- Keep? remove? do we care about boldness or format of text in results? 
- **IT DEPENDS**
![[Pasted image 20240116124915.png]]
#### why do we care?
- If doc 1 has token in <\title>, then it is more likely to be a good result than doc 2 where it is only in body
	- doc 1 may be more specu=
