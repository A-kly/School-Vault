# Why do we search?
Common tasks for web search engines:
- search for products/services, aka. business transactions
- search for reading materials of interest
- searching for answers to a specific question
**Note**: input to a search engine is called a query #definition
## Transactional queries
We know what we want and are trying to find it.
- **General web search engine** is mostly used
	- This is because of google adds and shit. Systems in place for it
	- Search engines can provide personalized results
## Informational queries
We don't know what we are looking for and we search documents for the answers. Answers are long and found in these documents
- We can use a **General web search engine** or a **specialized web search engine** (like ualberta library)
## Question answering
We want to answer a question where we don't know or are unsure of the answer. Answers are short, verifiable and very specific (one correct answer).
- Use a **general web search engine**, they are good because they have *knowledge graphs* consisting of info found on pages
- systems like ChatGPT can answer some questions correctly
## Other places where search engines are used
- Personal search (on your own computer, spotlight)
- Enterprise search (within an organization only)
- Vertical search (Across the web but about specific topics, eg. yelp)
# Documents, queries, tokens & terms
## Documents
- Storage and retrieval unit of a search system
	- system always returns documents or links to documents
- Examples:
	- Gmail returns links to emails (doc = email)
	- Yelp returns business profiles that it keeps (doc = business profiles)
	- Library returns book records (doc = book records)
When making search engine, you decide what documents are
## Queries
- Input to search engine
- Search interface can have multiple fields (beartracks), or single box (google)
- query is an **expression of the info needed by user**
- Types:
	- Keyword (self explanitory)
	- Phrase (uses "" in google)
	- Wildcard (uses * , regular expressions)
## Tokens
- *internal representation* of words appearing in documents and queries
- **tokenization** is the process of converting words in queries/documents to tokens.
	- eg, converts all of: "Hello", "hello", "hellO" to "hello"
	- "hello" is token
### Terms
- Terms are *unique tokens* among indexed documents.
- All terms are the **vocabulary of the system**.
- A query token that does appear in any document is called **out-of-vocabulary** (OOV)
	- system just discards that word
### Why tokenize?
- help users find documents that have words that are slightly different from words in documents
- removes inconsistencies across documents
- examples:
	- case folding (Edmonton -> edmonton)
	- removing punctuation (U.S.A -> USA)
	- Acronym expansion (AFN -> Assembly of First Nations)
# Architecture of a Search Engine
## At the highest level
- Documents added to an *index* and ordanized based on *terms*.
- documents can be deleted
- Users send queries and receive results through search interface
- engine matches *tokens* in *query* to *terms* in index to get documents with most of *query tokens*

## What will be covered in 361?
- How to tokenize documents and queries.
- How to represent documents.
- Different kinds of indexes, for different kinds of queries.
- Suitable data structures for representing indexes.
- Different methods for matching documents and queries.
## What about Web Search Engines?
- Main difference is that documents are found by *web crawlers* that continuously crawl
- engine has no control over quality of documents so it must be careful to avoid attacks and exploitation
- There is a separate index for terms -> advertisements

# Representing documents
## Term-Document incidence matrix
![[Pasted image 20240111125505.png|600]]
- We match terms to documents using a term-document incidence matrix
- This provides mapping of terms to documents
- the matrix keeps weights (`wij`) indicating the importance of term `ti` for document `Dj`
	- The higher the weight, the more important the term is for the document
	- ![[Pasted image 20240111125937.png|500]]
	- Common choices for `wij`:
		- Boolean: just tells if the term appears in the document.
		- Counts: frequency of `ti` in `Dj`.
		- tf-idf: balances frequency and rarity  of terms (later!).
## Documents as vectors
- Documents are n-dimensional vectors where `n = |V|` is the size of the **vocabulary of all documents** stored in the system.
- ![[Pasted image 20240111130644.png]]
- Document vectors do not keep word order (discussed later).
# Query answering (Boolean vs Ranking)
## Boolean queries
- term is boolean predicate
	- True if in doc
	- False otherwise
- Queries are boolean expressions using `AND` `OR` `NOT`
- easy
### Pros
- [p] Easy to understand.
- [p] Explainable.
- [p] Easy to implement.
- [p] Suitable for expert users.
### Cons
- [c] Hard to write (add an OR in the wrong place and you get too many documents!).
- [c] Treat all documents and all terms the same.
- [c] Documents are either "in" or "out".
	- No notion of a document being a "partial answers".
## Not all terms are the same
- Some are more useful than others
- eg: `tropical` and `aquarium` may be very common but `goldfish` and `bowl` are rare
- **Rare terms are more useful**
- *if a user writes rare terms into the query, we should prioritize the documents that contain said rare query*
## Query by ranking
- Main idea:
	1. Define a scoring function to determine document relevance
	2. Rank documents based on score
	3. return the top `K` documents sorted by decreasing score
- Properties of scoring function:
	- More query terms in doc, higher score
	- More repeats of query terms, higher score
	- more important/rare terms, higher score
### Scoring with vectors
- Docs are vectors
- queries can also be vectors with dimension of *system vocabulary*
	- ![[Pasted image 20240111132551.png]]
- if token *OOV*, ignore and do not add to vector
- The score of document can be computed using its vector and the query vector.
### Dot product
- How about the dot product as a scoring function?
	- ![[Pasted image 20240111132721.png]]
- It satisfies all desired properties when the term-document incidence matrix has counts as weights. (It also works with other weights, including tf-idf).
	- The more query terms in the query, the higher the score.
	- The more a term appears in a document, the more it should contribute to the score.
	- More important terms should contribute more to the score.

# Evaluation of Search Engines
- Different eval criteria for different users:
	- for CEO, max profit
	- for CTO, max uptime and efficiency
	- Search engineers, minimize bad content
	- Advertisers, Max exposure
	- ==End users==, *good answer*
## Evaluating the quality of answers
- build a benchmark with queries and answers (found by humans).
- doc is **relevant** for query if human thinks it should be
- **precision** of system is fraction of returned docs that are relevant
- **recall** is fraction of relevant docs returned
- ![[Pasted image 20240111133504.png|300]]
### Precision and recall are kinda opposites
- perfect recall = all docs returned
	- precision goes down
- when do we prioritize precision?
	- when giving a bad answer can have bad consequences 
	- e.g., giving the wrong cake recipe or returning a document with irrelevant information
- when do we prioritize recall?
	- when missing good answer can have bad consequences
	- e.g., missing a legal case that is very similar to the one you are building a defense for
