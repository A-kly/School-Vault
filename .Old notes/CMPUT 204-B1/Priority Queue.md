Implenented using [[Divide-and-Conquer]]
- Items are ordered in the queue based on priority
- Elements are associated with a key
- ![[Pasted image 20230208104146.png]]
- Ignore actual queue
- Work around heap to conceptually crate the queue
- Extract Maximun: Dequeue
	- ![[Pasted image 20230208104420.png]]
	- Remove max
	- Move last element to root and reduce size by 1
	- run max-heapify to maintain consistency and shifts elements over properly
	- Running time: O(log n)
- Increase Key : increase priority
	- ![[Pasted image 20230208104653.png]]
	- Bubble updated key node up until it is higher than children and lower than parent
	- O(log n)
- Insert element
	- ![[Pasted image 20230208104835.png]]
	- Create an infinitely low priority key and add it to end
	- increase priority of that node to get it to the right place
