-  Attitudes towards sexual activity are incredibly diverse. 
-  What is ‘normal’ is clearly influenced by sociocultural factors. 
-  Sexual behaviour may be labeled as abnormal if it: 
	-  deviates from the norms of one’s society. 
	-  is self-defeating/causes personal distress 
	-  harms others 
	-  interferes with one’s ability to function 
-  Examples of each?
# Gender Dysphoria
## Transgender
![[Pasted image 20240606151444.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240606150956.png]]
- Gender reassignment. Chastity Bono, left; Chaz Bono, right, in 2011. Bono had Gender Dysphoria and underwent hormone and surgical procedures to transition from anatomical female to male.
## DSM-5 Criteria: Gender Dysphoria (Adult & Adolescent)

-  A. A *marked incongruence* between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
	1. A marked incongruence between one’s *experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics* (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 
	2. A strong *desire to be rid* of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 
	3. A strong *desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender*. 
	4. A strong *desire to be of the other gender* (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).
	5. A strong desire to be *treated as the other gender* (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender). 
	6. A *strong conviction* that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender). 
- B. The condition is associated with clinically *significant distress* or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
- **Specify if:** *Post-transition:* The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natural female).
## GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER 
- **Gender Expression:**
	- The way one presents their gender outwardly.
- **Gender Identity:**
	- One’s psychological sense of being female or male or between or none.
- **Gender Dysphoria**
	- A disorder in which the individual believes that her or his anatomic gender is inconsistent with his or her psychological sense of being male or female.
## Treatment
- Hormone therapy
	- Lots of options
	- Controversial (calm down lmao)
	- Puberty blockers for under 18
		- Can have issues for fertility if stopped'
	- Withholding treatment can cause lasting psychological damage as well
- Living as the identified gender ≈ 1 year (RLE; Real Life Experience) 
	- Very often challenged
	- Legal requirement of 18 years or older or consent from parent
	- Legally use gendered washrooms they identify with
	- Requirement for surgery often (Depends on region)
- Sex reassignment surgery 
	- tracheal shave
	- Breast removal/construction
	- Vaginoplasty
		- Surgical removal of the penis and creation of a vagina
		- Outer shaft skin kept and turned into canal
		- Glands skin turned into clitoris / implanted deeper
		- Dilation required (ouch (??))
	- Phalloplasty
		- Clitoris embedded in shaft of penis created from skin taken from thigh or forearm
		- Normal size penis, erection achieved via prosthesis
		- Two different ways to make erect
			- implanted Malleable metal rods to bend into place
			- Implanted hydraulic erection system
	- Metoidioplasty
		- Vaginal lining is scraped and allowed to heal together to seal closed 
		- Alternative to phalloplasty 
		- Starts with hormone therapy to enlarge clitoris to about 5 cm 
		- Labia are fashioned into a scrotum, usually with prosthetic testicles 
		- Clitoris located at end; maintains orgasmic capacity
		- Higher levels of satisfaction than phalloplasty
- Psychotherapy 
	- Necessary throughout 
	- Important to screen for other conditions motivating the desire for gender change 
	- Since these are major, and partly irreversible surgeries, the decision to move forward should be made cautiously 
	- Excessive delays/refusal can also be risk factors
	- Other mental health conditions leading to identity disruption potentially
		- BPD
		- Schizophrenia (inhabited by a different gendered spirit)
	- Not giving support can lead to a LOT of psychological harm
### Please be aware…
- Gender transformation is a lifelong process: It neither begins nor ends with surgery
- Not every transgendered person will opt for the full range of affirming surgeries. They could conceivably choose whatever subset they feel best resolves their gender dysphoria.
	- For many, this may mean no surgeries or hormones at all.
# PARAPHILIC DISORDER
- Not all of them are problematic
## Too many to count…
- Exhibitionistic (GROSS)
	- Revealing themselves
- Fetishistic
	- Do not often result in criminal activity
		- Maybe criminal if stolen from someone
			- Fetish for stolen objects with a known owner
	- Feet is NOT a fetish, it is a **PARTIALISM**
		- It is part of the human body therefore is not a Fetish technically
- Transvestic
	- Not to be confused with GD
	- Sexually aroused by dressing as the opposite gender, NOT wanting to transition
		- About the crossdressing itself
	- Often in men
	- Autogynophelia is NOT this (and also not real)
- Voyeuristic (GROSS)
	- Viewing a not consenting person
	- Often a male viewing a female
	- Often in an intimate act or sexual act
	- Helped with technology due to cameras
		- Very easily hidden
		- Often planted in public change areas or washrooms
- Frotteuristic Disorder (GROSS)
	- Like Toucheristic disorder but touching generals to people specifically
- Toucheristic Disorder (GROSS)
	- People who touch people unconsentingly and sexually
	- Not direct rape
	- Not typically disrobing their victims
	- Quick feel and then gone
- Klismaphilic Disorder ==On exam== (GROSS)
	- Erotic interest in having an enema often from others
- Pedophilic (GROSS)
	- Sexual attraction to prepubescent or pubescent children under the age of consent
	- Largely about the level of physical development
	- May be more biologically rooted (still gross)
## The Development of Persistent Sexual Offending Against Children
- 2 components:
	- Antisociality
	- Sexual attraction to prepubescent children (pedophilia)
- The presence of both significantly increases likelihood that a person will offend against children
- **Conflation:** to combine or to equate tow or more things into one
	- Eg. Sexual interest in children is not the same thing as being a child molester
	- *BUT* biological predisposition to certain traits does not equate to it being legally okay
	- "..strength of concordance between paraphilic interests and behaviors varies across themes, and ...sex drive can moderate the strength and even direction of these associations for some themes; higher sex drive was associated with a stronger association for biastophilia *(sexual preference in rape, Not aroused by normal intercourse)* , masochism, sadism, somnophilia, and voyeurism, but it had a weaker association for pedohebephilia and zoophilia." (Seto et al, 2020)"
		- Sex drive has an effect on likeliness to act and also on strength of attraction with themes of biastophilia *(sexual preference in rape, Not aroused by normal intercourse)* , masochism, sadism, somnophilia, and voyeurism **BUT NOT REALLY WITH** pedohebephilia and zoophilia
## DSM-5 Criteria (Eg., Exhibitionistic Disorder)
- A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and *intense sexual arousal from the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person*, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors.
- B. The individual has *acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person*, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause *clinically significant distress or impairment* in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- Specify whether:
	- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children
	- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals
	- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children and to physically mature individuals
- Specify if;
	- In a *controlled environment:* This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to expose one’s genitals are restricted.
	- In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.
## ASSESSMENT OF EROTIC PREFERENCE
- Primary means is by patient self-report, though this is highly prone to distortion, especially when motivated by shame or possible legal censure.
- Examining web browsing history.
- VRT (visual reaction time tests)
	- Indirect. Based on viewing times and pattern
	- Abel battery:
		- Made by Jean Able
		- Also elicits a subjective rating from 1 (disgusting) to 7 (highly arousing)
			- Highly dependent on truthfulness of disclosures
		- Not always accepted in court
- Plethysmographic studies
	- "Plethysmo" = blood volume change
	- More direct. Measurement of arousal while watching/hearing stimuli in several categories.
	- Can be also used for erectile dysfunction
	- Not used forensically
		- Legally cannot force a person to generate or give evidence for themselves
![[Pasted image 20240606154314.png]]
- Bottom and Right only measure change in circumference
	- **Problem**: changes in length start first, may look like its getting smaller actually
- First one:
	- Glass / plexiglass cylinder with inflated seal
	- Blood increases in penis increases air pressure in tube and pushes some out, measures full blood volume
![[Pasted image 20240606154342.png]]
- Not used forensically or for determining sexual preference
- Detects darkness of red in vagina
	- More blood = darker color
- Problems:
	- Female genetalia engorgement cycles are much more dedicated and takes a LONG time to cycle aroused and not
	- Not good for comparison between stimuli
	- 
## Theoretical Perspectives
- Psychodynamic theory 
	- Castration anxiety leads to projection of sexual desires onto “safer” targets 
	- The penis vanishing into a vagina is symbolic of castration in this view 
	- Masochism is symbolic aggression toward the internalized father 
- Learning theory 
	- Learned associations between sexual pleasure and contextual stimuli 
	- Implications for partner intimacy/sustained attraction? 
		- Fails to explain why paraphilias (especially fetishes) aren’t more common 
			- *Most salient stimulus is the ones we attach to*
	- Observational (vicarious) learning
		- Concerns about *conflation*
## Treatment of Paraphilias
- Psychodynamic: Resolution of the Oedipal complex (and corresponding castration anxiety) allows the emergence of non-paraphilic interests. 
	- *Little empirical support* 
- Behaviour Therapy: Aversive conditioning
	- Make engaging in the behaviour a harmful experience
		- Doing something while getting an erection for example
		- ![[Pasted image 20240606164352.png]]
		- Use of ammonia inhalants through capsules or tube
		- This specific smell is HIGHLY incompatible with sexual arousal
		- Rooting moose liver or cow placenta is used sometimes for enhanced biological reaction
		- In real world, non lab environment, this is likely not to help much due to specific environmental conditioning
	- Prone to extinction 
	- No promotion of alternate interests
- CBT: Development of adaptive thoughts and social skills
- Pharmacological: SSRIs are sometimes helpful
	- problems: increases sense of wellbeing and reduces impulsiveness
	- delays orgasm if used for a long time
	- Could paraphilias be a subtype of OCD?
		- Not likely, intrusive thoughts are not distressing for them
## SEXUAL ASSAULT 
- Forcible Rape & “Statutory Rape” 
	- Overcome a person physically,  not asking vs Victim not able to give consent
- Incidence of Rape & Other Forms of Sexual Assault 
- Theoretical Perspectives
	- Many examples of rape are *pseudosexual* in nature
		- About exerting control
		- 2/3 to 3/4 correct scientifically
	- Sadism and general antisocial tendencies
	- Compensatory rape
		- Individual is socially weak and lame
		- Has fantasies of being strong and powerful
		- Has fixation on a person
		- Believes that if they continue to pursue them, they will fall in love with them
	- Psychosexual development limitation
		- Pedophilia caused by person getting stuck in earlier Psychosexual development stage and pursues partners because of that
- Possible Effects of Sexual Assault
	- Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
	- Depression
	- Impaired intimate relationships
	- Increased substance abuse
	- Lower sexual drive/enjoyment
	- Physical symptoms (eg, headache, disrupted menses)
- Treatment of Rape Survivors
	- Most important thing is to *communicate that the victim was not responsible for it*
	- Create a sense of safety for the victim
		- They are not in a perpetual state of danger
		- Things are okay and they can find good partners
	- Provide safety
	- Physical care
	- Possible Reconciliation
		1. Agreement that relationship can continue in a healthy manner
		2. Offender has to admit they did something wrong and that they wont do it again
		3. Victim and Offender need to believe that the offender is capable of avoiding behaviour
- Levels of assault
	- Level 1: non-consensual bodily contact for sexual purpose (least legally significant of the three)
	- Level 2: assault with a weapon (Medium significance)
	- Level 3: aggravated; physical harm and/or threat of death (Most significant)
- Incidence 
	- increased, then decreased, then increased in Covid
	- Intrafamilial sexual assault and dorm situations assault increased

	- Castration anxiety 
	- Guilt
- Learning Perspectives 
	- Cognitive Perspectives

		- Requires sexual stimulation
		- Can be penile injections as well, do not require stimulation
	- SSRIs: delay ejaculation
