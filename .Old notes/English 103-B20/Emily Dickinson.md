- "I'm nobody, who are you?"
	- What does it mean to be nobody? (free write)
	- In this poem, to be nobody means to be different from the rest of society, (almost like a rebel or reject), it is possible to hide that you're nobody and all of the somebodies are bad because they are "public like a frog". To be nobody is to be something other than the norm, and the norm is considered bad by the nobodies and good by the somebodies.
- "the sould selects her own society"
	- what does "renunciation, Isolation and Incorporeality" have to do with solitude
		- When you voluntarily go into solitude, you renounce your contact with the public and society. This may cause you to seem like a "ghost" to others and your being turns into a story and fades into the past rather than being an active participant in the present lives of others.
