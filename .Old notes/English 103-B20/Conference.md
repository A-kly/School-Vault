- Habitat selection
	- "In sum, his chosen location corresponds very faithfully to ancestral preferences. It abounds with animal and plant life, as well as with the critical resources of water and fuel. There are paths to facilitate movement to other places, as well as vantage points from which to survey more distant territory. "
	- "He demonstrates aesthetic appreciation of the site’s features, large and small, pointing out that the natural resources he enjoys are beautiful as well as useful."
- Studying Nature
	- "In his close examination of animal and plant life, seasonal cycles and elemental processes, we see at work the human propensity to understand “the natural world as illuminated by the scientific method” (Wilson, Biophilia 81)."
- Aethetics and cognition
	- "Much research in the field of evolutionary psychology begins with the hypothesis that the ancestral environment exercised important influence on development of human cognitive powers, including development of the aesthetic sense. "
	- "This leads him to speculate that “these forms” (vines, leaves, pine cones, and the like) “came to be transferred to our furniture” as cherished embellishment because once we lived “in their midst” (113)."
	- "He argues that we choose natural shapes as ornaments because of our long history of dependence on nature for everyday subsistence, that our aesthetic preferences are shaped by our involvement, as a species, with nature. Such comments are congruent with the theory that im- mersion in the ancestral environment exercised important influence on development of human psychological responses."
- Universal Kinship
	- "He expresses in the language of his day the idea, soon to be articulated systematically by Darwin, that humans are neither central nor special as a species, but part of a vast, global network of kinship."
	- "Thoreau’s eccentric views on human agriculture can best be understood in the context of cross-species kinship. Instead of lamenting weather conditions unfavorable to farming, he takes an ecosystemic perspective, "
	- "He regards the agricultural revolution with ambivalence for many reasons, not least because it is founded on the faulty premise of human supremacy."
	- " Thoreau is motivated, evidently, by the principle now defined as inclusive fitness. As George Hamilton was the first to demonstrate, indi- vidual fitness cannot not be measured merely by personal, or direct, reproductive success (i.e., number of offspring); rather, it includes the reproductive success of all those sharing genes with the target individu- al (Daley and Wilson 28-32). because assistance to relatives fosters the survival of shared genes. ...  ==Thoreau communicates an evolutionarily expansive version of this principle when he identifies members of non-human species as kin: their fitness contributes to his==."
	- " He packs his book with instances of personification such as these, reporting on his daily involvement with non-human others and conveying a “sense of the neighborliness of nature” (Buell 211)."
	- " Affiliating with life forms commonly regarded as insentient, like beech trees or pigweed, Thoreau indulges in humorous hyperbole to celebrate planet-wide familial ties,"
- The Ecosystem as a living entity
	- "As discussion thus far has  made clear, Thoreau operates according to a generous construction of  kinship, egalitarian in spirit, one not regulated by mathematical calculations of relatedness."
