## My thoughts
Thoughts on first (two) chapters of Walden
- VERY OLD SOUNDING
- Almost broken down into an essay structure but not quite
- Seems very personal and like a direct explanation of his thoughts and experiences
- Talks a lot about being alone but is also in constant contact with people

- How does Henry David Thoreau represent perspective? (prompt)
	- "this small lake" paragraph, pg. 77
	- What words or short phrases are most affecting or significant for his representation if perspective and overall argument, why?

		- "mid afternoon had all the serenity of evening"
			- From his previous time in the big city, this is a refreshing change

***
## Economy

- pg. 39 "and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the removal of the gods of troy"
	- person who has come to spectate has made the event momentous
	- WHY?
		- Is he completely in control of the narrative? (no)
		- Do we take him at his word (no)
		- __He makes meaning by interacting with other people__
	- Story isn't purely about what he's done but more about the philosophical implications of it
- pg. 42 (begins thinking about architecture, shell around oneself, natural world beauty, what is beauty?)
	- Is architecture a means of securing those around us or is it something more
	- "ornamental dwellings . . . ornaments of style"
		- What is inessential to literature?
			- Structure
			- flaky excess, conscious construction
			- dissection of literature until it looses true meaning
			- __unnecessarily complex 
			- 
- pg. 51 "give his body to the dogs"
	- Only those of immense significance are represented and preserved
		- So why should we care?? Life for ourselves!

## Where I lived, and what I lived for

- Listening to the body rather than listening to the daily schedule

## Sounds, Solitude, and Visitors

- Does Walden uphold the idea of solitude as something desirable?
- Is there anything isolating about nature?
	- Has conflicting feelings about being alone
	- Solitude is an experience but isn't always great
	- Sounds of nature is nice
	- Sound of train connects him to society
		- "planetary motion"
		- Mythical Image of an "iron horse"
		- Way to connect people (across the country and world), makes everything interconnected
		- Displaces what human behavior used to be

- Lots of contradictions in the book

Thoreau in Nature

How does Thoreau represent nature in Walden? Does he, like the poet, construct an "invisible fence" around Walden pond (73)? What does it mean that he resolves his section on "sounds" With an image of an "unfenced nature reaching up to your very sills" (114)?

- Once the poet captures the farm, it no longer belongs to the farmer

How does Thoreau explain our human connection with nature in the passage on the owls' singing in "Sounds" (111-112), in his claim that we are "not wholly involved in Nature" in "Solitude" (120), or in his observation about whom among his visitors had the most refined appreciation of nature in "visitors" (136-137)

- People worry to much about danger that isn't there
- Kids just like the experience
- business men worry about the distance from society

- Doubleness of enjoying being in nature but still being tied to other (potentially overall less important) things


Pathetic Fallacy

- Reflecting the _emotional experience_ of a poet or writer on an inanimate object
- Tends to be a bit Narcissistic
- Treating nature as a reflection of the writer
- Emotional experience of the writer _taints the reader's experience of the description of nature_
- Not an objective description
# The Ponds and Higher Laws

Free writing and notes:
- How does Thoreau portray time and space in "The Ponds" and "higher laws"?
	- The sense of space created when describing the pond makes the reader feel as though they are looking at the pond from very far away to visualize the descriptions he's using
	- Tree becoming waterlogged
	- passage of time from grandfather noticing water tree and grandson doing the same
		- passage of time though generations
	- Colour of Walden Pond
		- reflections of the sky, perceptions are malleable
