# Object-Oriented Models
![[Pasted image 20240112100427.png]]
## Java
Principal designer: James Gosling, Sun Microsystems
Language goals:
- simple, object-oriented
- robust, secure
- network and thread support
- “compile once, run anywhere”

- Language design inspired by …
	- Lisp - garbage collection, reflection (ask object info about itself)
	- Simula-67, C++ - classes
	- Algol-68 - overloading (same method name can take multiple kinds of parameters (multiple constructors))
	- Pascal, Modula-2 - strong type checking (ensuring types are compatible and checking it in the compiler (cannot call floats integers for example)) 
	- C - syntax (kinda)
	- Ada-  exceptions
	- Objective C, Eiffel - interfaces (take objects that are unrelated and treat them as if they are the same, *they can be thought of as **contracts** for classes saying "yes my object does this thing"*)
	- Modula-3 - threads
# UML (Unified Modeling Language)
Principal inventors: Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, James Rumbaugh
Purpose:
- express object-oriented designs visually
- programming language independent
- communicate, evaluate, and reuse designs
- make design intent more explicit
- can think about design, before coding
## Abstraction
- Object:
	- an entity with specific attribute values (state), behavior, and identity
	- typically instantiated from a class
- Class (factory and structure of objects):
	- associated type of an object
	- defines attributes and methods
### Java and UML Class
![[Pasted image 20240112102336.png]]
==*Class* is represented by a Box, any important *attributes* should be put in second box section (not used often), *methods* should be put in third box section.==

## Encapsulation
- Class:
	- access control for attributes and methods *(Getters or setters used instead)*
		- e.g., public or private
	- access is not the same as visibility 
	- “design by contract” *(public, private, protected)*
		- *public interface represents a contract between the developer who implements the class and the developer who uses the class*
### Example:

![[Pasted image 20240112103003.png|500]]
![[Pasted image 20240112103015.png]]
- This is the previous code in UML
- Notice how we use `name:type` notation in UML instead of `type name` notation.
- Attribute and method name order should be logical
- Constructor has same name as class

## Decomposition
Association relationship:
- “some” relationship between classes
	- e.g., between Book and Patron
### UML Association
![[Pasted image 20240112103632.png]]
- *Looks like database diagrams*
- related
- NOT ownership
## More decomposition
Aggregation relationship:
- weak “has-a” relationship
- whole “has-a” part
	- eg. hands has a fingers
- a part may belong to (be shared with) other wholes
- e.g., a Section and a Student
### Java and UML Aggregation
![[Pasted image 20240112104220.png|400]]
- section *has a* student
	- BUT *student can be shared with other classes*
- "DIAMOND GOES TO THE JEWLERY BOX"
	- aka, UML diamond goes to container or "holder" in the relationship
- **weak relationship = hollow diamond = students and sections can exist separately**
![[Pasted image 20240112104727.png]]
- one Locations can be held by several frames (cursor, etc. )
- one size can be held by many frames (Fullscreen, etc.)
## More MORE Decomposition
Composition relationship:
strong “has-a” relationship
exclusive containment of parts
related object life times
the whole cannot exist without having the parts; if the whole is destroyed, the parts should also be destroyed
often access the parts through the whole

==MISSED CLASS DUE TO PASSPORT APPOINTMENT, missed UML stuff==
# Generalization
- Look for commonalities:
	- Common attributes
		- eg. all vehicles have...?
	- common methods (behaviour)
		- eg. all vehicles have...?
- **Generalize:** find what is common and factor it out into a more general "base" abstraction

- **Implementation inheritance:** generalize about method signatures, method implementations, and/or attributes
- **General part:** Superclass/ base class defines attributes and methods to be shared
- **Specific part:** extends superclass, is a derived class (subclass) which can overide methods, add methods and add attributes
## Java Implementation Inheritance
```java
public class Shape { // superclass
	protected Location myLocation;
	public Shape() { … }
	public void setLocation( Location p ) { … }
	public Location getLocation() { … }
	}
	

public class Circle extends Shape { // subclass
	private int diameter;
	public Circle() { … }
	public void setDiameter( int d ) { … }
	…
	}
	
public class Square extends Shape { // subclass
	private int side;
	public Square() { … }
	public void setSide( int s ) { … }
	}
```
- Both circle and square extend shape
- a circle is not a square
- a square is not a circle
- a shape is a shape
- circle and square have added attributes
	- diameter for circle
	- side for square
