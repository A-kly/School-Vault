e.g., filter model of attention

- analogies may be useful--even if ultimately __________, by definition

e.g., Locke: newborn is a _tabula rasa_--but is not literally a “blank slate”

- models often represented as a mathematical expression or computer program; “boxes and arrows” in cognitive psychology
