## What is Cognitive Psychology?

### Dictionary Definitions

- **cognition**: Middle English -cognicioun-, from Latin -cognitio-, to learn; to ==know== (Encarta, 2000)
- **cognitive psychology**: “a general approach to psychology emphasizing the Internal, ==mental processes==. Behaviour...requires explanations at the level of mental events, mental representations, beliefs and intentions” (Reber & Reber, 2001, p.135)
	- behaviour explained in terms of underlying ==mechanisms==
	- what are these mental processes and representations?

### Classic Definition

- **cognitive psychology**: “all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used” (Neisser, 1967, p.4)
	- information may be changed or ==removed==
	- new information is connected to other information
	- Keep information and get it later
	- these processes have a ==Purpose==

### Information-Processing Definition

- **cognitive psychology**: the experimental study of human information processing
- assumption: the mind is “a complex system that receives, stores, retrieves, transforms, and transmits information” (Stillings et al., 1987, p.1)
- characteristics:
	-  processing capacity is ==limited== due to attention
	-  cognition takes ==time==, multiple stages inferred
	-  processing stages are ==interdependent==,  processes cannot be isolated
- basic domains: attention, pattern perception, learning, memory,...
- higher-level domains: language processing, problem solving, decision-making,...
- hardware:software *as* Brain:?

## History

### Ancient Greek Philosophers

- basic assumptions
	- the world can be understood and predicted
	- ==People== are part of the world
	- explanations should be of this world (not magical)
- Plato (b.428? - d.348? BCE):
	- **Rationalism**: knowledge is obtained via thinking and logical analysis
		- Thinking about things we know generated new knowledge
- Aristotle (b.384 - d.322 BCE):
	- **empiricist**: knowledge is acquired through experience and observation
		- Do things to gather new knowledge

### Renaissance Philosophers

- René Descartes (b.1596 - d.1650):
	- French **rationalist**
	- “-cogito, ergo sum-” (“I think, therefore I am”)
	- Cartesian dualism: mind and body are distinct entities interacting in humans
- John Locke (b.1632 - d.1704):
	- British **empiricist**
	- tablula rasa- (“==blank slate==”): at birth, we know nothing; we acquire knowledge through empirical observation
- Immanuel Kant (b.1724 - d.1804):
	- **dialectically synthesized** the views of Descartes and Locke
	- *contended* that both rationalism and empiricism contribute to understanding

### The 19th Century

- psychology: the scientific study of conscious ==experience==

**Structuralism**

- goals:
	- analyze conscious processes into their basic ==elements==
	- discover how the elements become ==connected==
	- specify the laws of connection
- Wilhelm Wundt (b.1832-d.1920):
	- opened first psychology lab, University of Leipzig (1879)
	- **introspection**: analyze your own conscious experience into sensations, images, & affections
	- problems:
		-  introspection failed (low reliability; biased: trainer’s influence seen in observer’s results; not independently ==verifiable== )

**Functionalism**

- goals:
	- determine the ==adaptive== significance of thought processes
	- find how and why the ==mind== works
		- e.g., how do people change and adapt to their environments?
- specify ==relationships== between stimuli and responses
- William James (b.1842-d.1910):
	- published -The Principles of Psychology- (1890), which foreshadowed much of cognitive psychology
	- problems:
		-  not based on experimentation
		-  theories did not make testable predictions

**Associationism**

- goals:
	- determine how events/ideas become ==associated==
	- e.g., contiguity, frequency, similarity, contrast
	- understand how association produces ==learning==
- F.C. Donders (1868):
	- studied mental chronometry using reaction time (RT) and **subtraction method**
		- *Task A* (==Simple== RT): 1 light, 1 button
			- RTA = stimulus detection + motor response
		- *Task B* (==Choice== RT): 2 lights, 2 buttons
			- RTB = stimulus detection + stimulus identification + response selection + motor response
			- **RT for stimulus identification + response selection = RTB - RTA**
			- But how to separate these?
		- *Task C* (go/no go RT): 2 lights, 1 button (==ingore== one light)
			- **RTC = stimulus detection + stimulus identification + motor response**
			- **RT for stimulus identification = RTC - RTA**
			- **RT for response selection = RTB - RTC**
	
	- assumed “==pure insertion==”: time to complete each stage is independent of the other stages
	- problems:
		-  RTC not always shorter than RTB
		-  motor response times may be different in different tasks
		-  novice performance not comparable to expert performance
	- Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885):
		- used 2,000 3-letter nonsense syllables to measure his memory
		- this removed familiarity effects (e.g., -bat- vs. -cat-)
			- nonsense words make all familiarity unimportant
		- found forgetting was rapid at first, then more gradual (the “forgetting curve,” which is actually a “retention curve”)
	
	![forgetting curve](p258s01-02-1.png)
	
	- problem:
		-  it’s hard to remember ==nonsense==

**Psychoanalysis**

- goals:
	- develop psychological understanding of psychopathologies
	- apply psychotherapeutic ==treatment==
- Sigmund Freud (b.1856-d.1939):
	- proposed different levels of awareness - some items unavailable to consciousness
	- methods included introspection, dream analysis, hypnosis
- problems:
	-  criticized as unscientific, unfalsifiable, and not based on experimental evidence

### The Early 20th Century
- psychology: the science of ==conscious== behaviour

**Behaviourism**

- goals:
	- study (describe, quantify) ==observable== behaviours
	- how they are ==learned==
	- how they are modified by the environment
- J.B. Watson (b.1878-d.1958):
	- shifted study of mind to study of behaviour
	- saw the mind as a “==black box==”
- B.F. Skinner (b.1904-d.1990):
	- we are shaped by our environment, not by free will
	- problem:
		-  criticized for ignoring mental processes

**Gestalt approach**

- goals:
	- ==holistic== approach that emphasized consciousness
		- NON STRUCTURALIST
	- described how the whole is different than the sum of its parts
- Max Wertheimer (b.1880-d.1943):
	- founded Gestalt psychology (“form”, “configuration”)
	- problems:
		-  described--but did not explain--consciousness

### The Mid-20th Century

- psychology: science of behaviour and ==mental== processes

#### The Cognitive revolution/renaissance:

- limits of behaviourism:
	- Edward Tolman (1932):
		- trained rats in a maze to get food via direct route to food box
		- **when forced to take roundabout pathway, rats successfully reached the food box--despite lack of reinforcement for this route**
		- rats must be using a **cognitive map**
		- this contradicted basic behaviourist principles of learning
- Karl Lashley (1951):
	- argued that behaviourist explanations of language, using stimulus-response ==chains== were inadequate
	- e.g., spoonerisms (“our queer old dean” instead of “our dear old Queen”) are novel, nonhabitual recombinations
	- organization in language comes from **within the organism** (not from outside)
- advances in ==linguistics==
	- Noam Chomsky (1959):
		- published criticism of Skinner’s (1957) *Verbal Behavior*
		- concluded that **behaviourist accounts of language were lacking**
		- language is **not merely imitation**
- emergence of human factors/cognitive engineering/applied cognitive psychology
		- rapid technological advances in WWII led to problems with skills and performance
		- engineering perspective on human information processing applied
		- important factors include: alertness, sensitivity to environmental conditions (e.g., heat, noise, sleep loss), distinguishing relevant vs. irrelevant information, multiple task performance
- rise of ==constructivism==
	- Jean Piaget (1923):
		- explained children’s cognitive development via **schèmes**: mental structures that provide the basis for thought
		- **schemes organize experience and knowledge**
		- contain information about actions one can perform on objects
		- change through developmental stages
- contributions from ==Computing science==
	- artificial intelligence (AI) related to cognition
- new conceptualizations of (and research on) ==memory==
	- e.g., “The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two” (Miller, 1956)
		- this is the description of the items we can store in short term memory
- ==Publications== of Ulric Neisser’s (1967) -Cognitive Psychology-

## The Scientific Method

- Goal of psychology: describe, ==explain==, predict, and control behaviour and mental processes
	- **theory**: set of related principles that simplify and organize some aspect of the world
	- e.g., Gestalt theory, Psychoanalytic theory
	- typically represented as ==verbal== statements
	- helps to describe, explain, predict, and control behaviour and mental processes
	- **model**: representation of a specific phenomenon that predicts and simulates empirical data
		- derived from a theory; *narrower in focus*
		- typically employs an ==analogy== or metaphor for a psychological process (analogy: logical inference, based on the assumption that if two things seem similar in -some- respects, then they may be alike in -other- respects)
			- e.g., filter model of attention
		- analogies may be useful--even if ultimately ==inaccurate==, by definition
			- e.g., Locke: newborn is a -tabula rasa---but is not literally a “blank slate”
		- models often represented as a mathematical expression or computer program; “boxes and arrows” in cognitive psychology
		- although descriptive, may not be explanatory
- The scientific method:
	1. ask questions/make observations/describe the phenomenon
	2. develop an explanation (a theory or model)
	3. generate a **hypothesis**: testable prediction derived from a theory
	4. design the research study; select methodology
	5. collect relevant information
	6. ==analyze== the data; compare results with the hypothesis
	7. solicit peer reviews and ------ findings:
	
	- provide facts
	- test theories
	- give insight into research methods

## Cognitive Science

- ==interdisciplinary== field, which includes anthropology, linguistics, psychology, philosophy, computing science
- **based on tri-level hypothesis (Marr, 1982)**:
	1. **Computational Theory**
		- What is the system doing?
			- e.g., multiplication is the product of two numbers; repeated addition: the sum of X groups of Y items
	1. **Representation and Algorithm**\
		- "structure and process"
		- How is the problem symbolized?
		- What steps are being used to solve the problem?
			- e.g., 9+9+9+9+9, or 5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5+5, or digital bit shifting, or Karatsuba algorithm, or...
	3. **Hardware Implementation**
		- What physical components carry out these operations?
		- e.g., fingers, or brain, or abacus, or calculator, or computer, or...
		- (Almost exclusively, cognitive psychology focuses on the ==second== level.)
		- Application: consider a person playing ==chess== against a computer
		- How are they the same? How are they different?

## Artificial Intelligence (AI)

- employs the ==computational== metaphor in a simulation of behaviour or mental process
- what can we learn by comparing the human mind to a computer?
- a lot, if they’re both doing the same thing (level 1) -*in the ==same== way*- (level 2)
- this **functionalist** approach can lead to “==strong== equivalence” (vs. “==Pure AI==”: looking for the best solution) and escapes the problem of analogy

Benefits of building bridges between cognitive psychology and AI (Reed, 2019):
- computational programs in AI can serve as potential theoretical ==models== in cognitive psychology
	- e.g., hierarchical network model of semantic memory
- both share common interests that may lead to greater reciprocal understanding
	- e.g., pattern classification is studied by both fields: human visual object categorization and AI image processing
- the integration of AI into everyday life requires a better understanding of human-AI ==teaming==
	- e.g., IBM's WatsonPaths AI system analyzes medical data to give physicians the most likely diagnosis or most appropriate treatment

## Some Common Themes (NON TESTABLE)

Cognitive processes:

- are (inter-)==active==
	- the mind is constructive; internal processes change information
- are efficient and (generally) ==accurate==
	- errors often byproducts of otherwise accurate processes
- better handle ==positive== information
	- biased towards retaining information that fits with our beliefs
- are interrelated
	- but often studied ==seperately==
- rely on two processes
	- bottom-up (based on low-level sensory processes) and top-down (based on higher-level cognitive processes)
- can be ==unconscious==
	- much depends on automatic processing, priming, and implicit memory
	- also called “system 1” (Stanovich & West, 2000)
