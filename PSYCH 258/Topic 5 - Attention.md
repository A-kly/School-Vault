## Selective & Divided Attention

- **==Selective== attention**: attending to a stimulus while ignoring others; also called focused attention
	- e.g., reading a textbook while trying to ignore interruptions
- **divided attention**: attending to two or more simultaneous stimuli
	- e.g., driving, drinking a coffee, and talking on cell phone at the same time

## Controlled & Automatic Processing

- Spelke, Hirst, & Neisser (1976): Can practice turn a controlled task into an automatic one?
	- participants read stories while writing down words read aloud
	- performance poor, but gradually improved
	- after 6 weeks, people ==could== both read and take dictation as well as either task alone

| **Automatic**                           | **Controlled/Effortful**                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| no attentional resources                | require resources                            |
| occur without intention                 | require conscious intention                  |
| not available to consciousness          | conscious activities                         |
| fast                                    | slow                                         |
| familiar, unchanging tasks              | may be novel, variable tasks                 |
| no interference with other mental tasks | produce interference with other mental tasks |
| practiced, skilled responses            | rule-following responses                     |

## The Myth of Multitasking

- The myth: Like computers, people are more efficient at getting things done when they perform multiple tasks at the same time.

- Evidence:
	- children perform worse on their homework if it is done while watching TV
	- using a cell phone while driving degrades driving ability; even with practice, performance does not improve
	- studies show that “multitaskers” actually just ==switch== rapidly between tasks (called task-switching, time-sharing, and multiplexing)

- Rubinstein, Meyer, & Evans (2001): Is multitasking more efficient?
	- Experiment 1:
		- multitasking group told to write a report and check their email at the same time
		- second group told to complete one task before doing the other
		- multitaskers took about 50% ==longer== than second group
	- Experiment 2:
		- participants switched between solving math problems and classifying geometric figures
		- the more difficult the problems and the more complex the rules used in sorting, the more time the participants lost in switching
		- executive control has two distinct, complementary stages:
			- **==goal== shifting**: “I want to do this now instead of that”
			- **==rule== activation**: “I’m turning off the rules for that and turning on the rules for this”
			- switching between tasks has a cost; repeated switching can add up--as much as 40% of a person’s productive time

- Ophir, Nass, & Wagner (2009): What’s the difference between heavy- and light-multitaskers?
	- participants: students who frequently performed media multitasking, and non-multitaskers
	- tasks: computer-based working memory and attentional processing tasks
	- heavy multitaskers did significantly worse than light multitaskers:
	- more susceptible to ==distracting== items, which caused more errors
	- less able to filter out irrelevant interference from interruptions
	- performed more ==slowly== on tasks that required them to quickly switch between tasks
	- high-multitaskers adopt a breadth-biased strategy of information processing: attention is driven by external cues (called **==reactive==**, a form of bottom-up processing)
	- in contrast, attention can be controlled by higher-level cognition in service of a specific goal (called **==proactive==**; top-down processing)
	- but does multitasking cause--or is it caused by--the weaknesses in cognitive control shown by heavy multitaskers?
		- i.e., Does media-multitasking make people more distractible, or are people who are more easily distracted become media-multitaskers?

- Just & colleagues (2001): What happens in the brain during multitasking?
	- measured brain activity while participants:
		- a) did an auditory sentence comprehension task
		- b) mentally rotated a 3-D figure
	- showed minimal task similarity: regions activated by each task barely ==overlapped==
	- when doing both tasks simultaneously:
		- performance slowed down and errors increased
		- brain activity was two-thirds ==less== than the total devoted to both tasks when performed separately
	- conclusion: the brain cannot simply double its efforts when there are two problems to solve at the same time

- Dux, Marois, & colleagues (2009): What prevents the brain from multitasking?
	- used fMRI scans when people were juggling two tasks
	- ==prefrontal== cortex appeared to deal with the tasks one by one, creating a mental bottleneck
	- thus, limits on processing arose from slow processing in the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s central executive

- Poldrack & colleagues (2006): How does multitasking affect learning?
	- participants learned a simple card classification task by trial and error, while in fMRI scanner:
		- control group learned without distractions
		- experimental group performed task while also listening to high and low beeps, counting the number of high beeps
	- no difference in classification performance
	- however, experimental group was not able to ==extrapolate== their knowledge to new cards
	- focused attention during learning activated the ==hippocampus== - used in declarative (explicit) memory formation
	- learning while multitasking activated the ==striatum== -used in habit learning, which is applied less flexibly in new situations

## Filter & Bottleneck Theories

E. Colin Cherry (1953): How does attention process speech?

- **==binaural== presentation**: two different messages presented simultaneously to both ears
	- ![binaural presentation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-01.png)
	- almost impossible to ==shadow== a single message (repeat out loud what you have just heard)
	- practical problem: in the 1950s, air traffic controllers hearing multiple pilot messages over loudspeakers would get them mixed up
- **==dichotic== presentation**: two different messages; one presented to each ear
	- ![dichotic presentation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-02.png)
	- participants accurately **==shadowed==** messages
	- could tell ==sensory== characteristics from unattended ear: music/noise/speech; male/female voice
	- no ==semantic== (meaning-based) processing
	- **“==cocktail party==” effect**: the ability to selectively attend to one message while ignoring all other messages
		- e.g., having a conversation in the middle of a noisy party and not attending to others
	- how is one message selected over others?
		- “how do we recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time (the ‘cocktail party problem’)?” (Cherry, 1953, pp. 975-976)

- **Filter Model** (Donald Broadbent, 1958):
	- **==early== selection**: information filtered -*before*- semantic analysis
		- ![Broadbent’s Filter Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-03.png)
	- **split-span (dichotic) experiment**:

| **left ear:** | **right ear:** |
| :-----------: | :------------: |
|     seven     |      four      |
|     four      |      one       |
|     three     |      nine      |
- recall digits by ear (7-4-3 or 4-1-9): 65% correct
- recall the digits by pairs (7-4 or 4-1 or 3-9): 20% correct
- ==shifting== attention uses energy, takes time; pairwise recall takes more attention
- multiple tasks performed by attention switching back and forth between them
- problems:
- [c] Moray (1959):
	- found that important information from unattended ear was processed (e.g., hearing “Fire!” or your name)
		- suggests ==semantically== relevant content is **not filtered out early on**
- [c] Gray & Wedderburn (1960):
	- Oxford undergraduates found ==errors== occurred in dichotic shadowing experiments

| **left ear:** | **right ear:** |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Dear          | nine           |
| seven         | Aunt           |
| Jane          | six            |
- implies filtering not based on “==location==,” but on semantic properties
- [c] Treisman (1960):
	- similar shadowing experiment
	- message in attended ear was switched to unattended ear:

| **left ear:**                              | **right ear:**                                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| In the picnic basket she had peanut butter | cat, large, day, apple, friend, every, select, |
| book, leaf, roof, sample, always           | sandwiches and chocolate brownies...           |
- participants momentarily ==followed== message to the other ear!
- conclusion: unattended signals are being analyzed
- incoming stimuli other than the target are ==attenuated== (weakened)

- **Attenuation Model** (Treisman, 1964):
	- attenuator analyzes stimuli on the basis of:
		- physical characteristics
		- language (syllables, words)
		- meaning
	- ![Treisman’s Attenuation Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-04.png)

	- further processing occurs if information meets **==pattern== recognition threshold** in the “dictionary unit”
	- e.g., common words, high importance (your name or “Help!”), relevance/expectations (words that fit the current context)
	- problem:
		- [c] MacKay (1973):
			- attended ear presented with sentence: “They threw stones toward the bank yesterday.”
			- non-attended ear presented with words including “==money==” or “==river==”
			- recognition task: 4.2% more likely to (incorrectly) recognize: “They threw stones toward the savings and loan association yesterday.” despite no memory for hearing “==money==”
			- information from unattended ear processed to the level of meaning; implies -*late*- selection

- **Late Selection Models** (Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963; Norman, 1968):
	- stimuli are filtered after processing based on their physical properties and meaning
	- selection based on importance of recognized item, or meaning
	- memory processes devoted to selected inputs
	- ![Late Selection Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-05.png)
	- problem:
		- [c] unlikely that all incoming stimuli are processed by deep semantic analysis

## Early or Late Selection?
- Johnston & Wilson (1980):
	- participants heard word pairs, one of which was occasionally a word from a *target category* (e.g., animals)
	- target words were ==homonyms== (e.g., “bear” vs "bare")
	- simultaneously paired nontarget word was:
		- appropriate (e.g., “==hybernate==”)
		- inappropriate (e.g., “==naked==”)
		- or neutral (e.g., “luck”)
	- ==divided== attention: observers not told which ear would get the target
		- detection of targets improved with appropriate nontargets
		- worse with inappropriate
	- ==focussed== (selective) attention: observers told which ear the target would appear in
		- nontargets had no effect on target detection
	- ![Johnston & Wilson graph](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-06.png)
	- amount of attention given to ==nontargets== was as much as needed to accomplish the task

- **==Multimode== Theory** (Johnston & Heinz, 1978):
	- there may be *multiple* filters (preattentive and attentive)
	- to minimize demands on capacity, early selection may occur, filtering out unnecessary stimuli ( ==selective== attention)
	- to evaluate a broad range of incoming information, late selection may occur (divided attention)

## Visual Attention

- **==Feature Integration== Theory** (Treisman, 1986; Treisman & Gelade, 1980)
	- Anne Treisman (b.1935, d.2018) won the 2009 Grawemeyer Award in Psychology, and received the 2011 US National Medal of Science
	- ***attention must be focused on particular stimulus attributes or parts in space to construct a representation or percept***
	1. **==Preattentive== stage**:
		- rapid, automatic decomposition of stimulus into a number of basic properties (“primitives”)
		- processing is in parallel
	2. **==Focused== attention stage**:
		- serial process
		- spatial location selected, and primitives existing at this spot are combined
			- e.g., redness and X shape combined into red X
		- combination object is called ==object file==; only exists temporarily to be examined by focused attention

- Visual search:
	- primitives determined via **visual search** experiments:
	- task: find target among nontargets/“distractors”
	- observers asked whether a display contains target
	- RT (& errors) are recorded
	- types of visual search:
		- **==Feature== search**: target defined by one basic property/primitive
			- e.g., find a green 2 among red 2s
			- ![feature search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-07.png)
		- **==conjunction== search**: target defined by a combination of two or more basic properties/primitives
			- e.g., find a green 5 among green and red 2s, and red 5s
			- ![conjunction search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-08.png)
		- **spatial configuration search**: target defined by arrangement of features
			- e.g., find a 5 among 2s
			- ![spatial configuration search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-09.png)
	- “**==pop-out==**”: time needed to find the target is very short/constant
		- RT not influenced by number of distractors
		- primitives cause pop-out in feature search:
			- e.g., colour, brightness, orientation, length, curvature, etc.

Pros & cons:

- [p] evidence: **illusory conjunctions** (conjunction errors): when attention is overtaxed, primitives may be incorrectly combined
	- e.g., red Xs, blue Os: you may perceive a blue X
	- e.g., Stroop effect (1935): shows attentional inhibition of automatic cognitive processes
- [p] evidence: **feature present/feature absent effect**: target features that are present are better detected than target features that are absent (Treisman & Souther, 1985)
- [p] explains **-------**: how separate aspects of a stimulus (colour, form, motion, location) are combined into a holistic percept
- [c] contrary evidence: Schneider & Shiffrin (1977)
	- visual search task
	- different-category: scan for a certain number in a field of letters
	- same-category: scan for a certain letter in a field of letters
	- same-category: took longer, more errors
	- however, with enough practice, participants could automatically discriminate:
	- arbitrary groups of letters
	- real letters vs. artificial letters
	- regular vs. mirror-image letters
	- with practice, conjunction search can become automatic/----------contrary to FIT
- [c] attention is more than just a binding agent
	- Application of visual search (Wolfe & colleagues, 2005):
	- when targets in visual search are rare, do ------ increase?
	- e.g., radiological screening for breast cancer, or airport baggage screening
	- experiment simulated baggage screening: search images for targets (tools)
		- a) 20 in 40 images had target: miss rate = 7%; ------ RTs
		- b) 20 in 2000 images had target: miss rate = 30%; ------ RTs
- repeated negative responses (“no, no, no,...”) lead to speed/accuracy trade-off: repeated responses are faster, but produced more misses
- **the ---------- effect**: “if you don’t find it often, you often don’t find it”
- are the results the same in the real world, with real baggage screeners?

## Inattention

**Inattentional ---------**: if stimulus is presented, but is not -attended-, it is not perceived (coined by Mack & Rock, 1998; a.k.a. “looked-but-didn’t-see” problem)

Neisser (1979):

- showed videos of two overlapping basketball teams
- task: count the number of passes made by black-shirted team
- about 50% of viewers ------- the -----

Simons & Chabris (1999):

- showed participants a video of two teams of three basketball players
- task: count how many times the players wearing white pass the basketball
- 46% of observers ------ the -------

**Attentional -----**: when stimuli are presented in a series, one target stimulus interferes with the ability to detect a subsequent target

Shapiro, Arnell, & Raymond (1997):

- used rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)
- a string of stimuli presented briefly (100 ms each)
- first target stimulus is presented (e.g., white letter)
- second target stimulus follows (e.g., “X”)
- second target unlikely to be --------
- may be due to attention being “used up” for 500 ms after an event

**------ blindness**: an inability to detect changes in an object or a scene

Levin & Simons (1997):

- participants told to “pay close attention” to a video of a conversation
- only 1 of 10 participants noticed any -------

Simons & Levin (1998):

- only ---- of the participants noticed a change in the stranger
- changes may be local or global, fast or slow
- however, people -do- notice changed sex, race, or social group

Implications:

- attention is limited: ------- awareness
- not everything presented to our senses is ---------
- visual encoding must be ------
