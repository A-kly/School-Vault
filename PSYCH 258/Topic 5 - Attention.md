## Selective & Divided Attention

- **==Selective== attention**: attending to a stimulus while ignoring others; also called focused attention
	- e.g., reading a textbook while trying to ignore interruptions
- **divided attention**: attending to two or more simultaneous stimuli
	- e.g., driving, drinking a coffee, and talking on cell phone at the same time

## Controlled & Automatic Processing

- Spelke, Hirst, & Neisser (1976): Can practice turn a controlled task into an automatic one?
	- participants read stories while writing down words read aloud
	- performance poor, but gradually improved
	- after 6 weeks, people ==could== both read and take dictation as well as either task alone

| **Automatic**                           | **Controlled/Effortful**                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| no attentional resources                | require resources                            |
| occur without intention                 | require conscious intention                  |
| not available to consciousness          | conscious activities                         |
| fast                                    | slow                                         |
| familiar, unchanging tasks              | may be novel, variable tasks                 |
| no interference with other mental tasks | produce interference with other mental tasks |
| practiced, skilled responses            | rule-following responses                     |

## The Myth of Multitasking

- The myth: Like computers, people are more efficient at getting things done when they perform multiple tasks at the same time.

- Evidence:
	- children perform worse on their homework if it is done while watching TV
	- using a cell phone while driving degrades driving ability; even with practice, performance does not improve
	- studies show that “multitaskers” actually just ==switch== rapidly between tasks (called task-switching, time-sharing, and multiplexing)

- Rubinstein, Meyer, & Evans (2001): Is multitasking more efficient?
	- Experiment 1:
		- multitasking group told to write a report and check their email at the same time
		- second group told to complete one task before doing the other
		- multitaskers took about 50% ------ than second group
	- Experiment 2:
		- participants switched between solving math problems and classifying geometric figures
		- the more difficult the problems and the more complex the rules used in sorting, the more time the participants lost in switching
		- executive control has two distinct, complementary stages:
		- **---- shifting**: “I want to do this now instead of that”
		- **---- activation**: “I’m turning off the rules for that and turning on the rules for this”
		- switching between tasks has a cost; repeated switching can add up--as much as 40% of a person’s productive time

- Ophir, Nass, & Wagner (2009): What’s the difference between heavy- and light-multitaskers?
	- participants: students who frequently performed media multitasking, and non-multitaskers
	- tasks: computer-based working memory and attentional processing tasks
	- heavy multitaskers did significantly worse than light multitaskers:
	- more susceptible to ----------- items, which caused more errors
	- less able to filter out irrelevant interference from interruptions
	- performed more ------ on tasks that required them to quickly switch between tasks
	- high-multitaskers adopt a breadth-biased strategy of information processing: attention is driven by external cues (called **--------**, a form of bottom-up processing)
	- in contrast, attention can be controlled by higher-level cognition in service of a specific goal (called **---------**; top-down processing)
	- but does multitasking cause--or is it caused by--the weaknesses in cognitive control shown by heavy multitaskers?
		- i.e., Does media-multitasking make people more distractible, or are people who are more easily distracted become media-multitaskers?

- Just & colleagues (2001): What happens in the brain during multitasking?
	- measured brain activity while participants:
		- a) did an auditory sentence comprehension task
		- b) mentally rotated a 3-D figure
	- showed minimal task similarity: regions activated by each task barely ----------
	- when doing both tasks simultaneously:
	- performance slowed down and errors increased
	- brain activity was two-thirds ---- than the total devoted to both tasks when performed separately
	- conclusion: the brain cannot simply double its efforts when there are two problems to solve at the same time

Dux, Marois, & colleagues (2009): What prevents the brain from multitasking?

- used fMRI scans when people were juggling two tasks
- ---------- cortex appeared to deal with the tasks one by one, creating a mental bottleneck
- thus, limits on processing arose from slow processing in the prefrontal cortex, the brain’s central executive

Poldrack & colleagues (2006): How does multitasking affect learning?

- participants learned a simple card classification task by trial and error, while in fMRI scanner:
- control group learned without distractions
- experimental group performed task while also listening to high and low beeps, counting the number of high beeps
- no difference in classification performance
- however, experimental group was not able to ----------- their knowledge to new cards
- focused attention during learning activated the -------------used in declarative (explicit) memory formation
- learning while multitasking activated the ----------used in habit learning, which is applied less flexibly in new situations

## Filter & Bottleneck Theories

E. Colin Cherry (1953): How does attention process speech?

- **-------- presentation**: two different messages presented simultaneously to both ears

![binaural presentation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-01.png)

- almost impossible to ------ a single message (repeat out loud what you have just heard)
- practical problem: in the 1950s, air traffic controllers hearing multiple pilot messages over loudspeakers would get them mixed up
- **-------- presentation**: two different messages; one presented to each ear

![dichotic presentation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-02.png)

- participants accurately **--------** messages
- could tell ------- characteristics from unattended ear: music/noise/speech; male/female voice
- no -------- (meaning-based) processing
- **“-------- -----” effect**: the ability to selectively attend to one message while ignoring all other messages

e.g., having a conversation in the middle of a noisy party and not attending to others

- how is one message selected over others?

“how do we recognize what one person is saying when others are speaking at the same time (the ‘cocktail party problem’)?” (Cherry, 1953, pp. 975-976)

**Filter Model** (Donald Broadbent, 1958):

- **----- selection**: information filtered -before- semantic analysis

![Broadbent’s Filter Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-03.png)

- split-span (dichotic) experiment:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**left ear:**|**right ear:**|
|seven|four|
|four|one|
|three|nine|

- recall digits by ear (7-4-3 or 4-1-9): --% correct
- recall the digits by pairs (7-4 or 4-1 or 3-9): 20% correct
- -------- attention uses energy, takes time; pairwise recall takes more attention
- multiple tasks performed by attention switching back and forth between them
- problems:

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) Moray (1959):

- found that important information from unattended ear was processed (e.g., hearing “Fire!” or your name)
- suggests ------------ relevant content is not filtered out early on

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) Gray & Wedderburn (1960):

- Oxford undergraduates found ------ occurred in dichotic shadowing experiments

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**left ear:**|**right ear:**|
|Dear|nine|
|seven|Aunt|
|Jane|six|

- implies filtering not based on “--------,” but on semantic properties

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) Treisman (1960):

- similar shadowing experiment
- message in attended ear was switched to unattended ear:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**left ear:**|**right ear:**|
|In the picnic basket she had peanut butter|cat, large, day, apple, friend, every, select,|
|book, leaf, roof, sample, always|sandwiches and chocolate brownies...|

- participants momentarily -------- message to the other ear!
- conclusion: unattended signals are being analyzed
- incoming stimuli other than the target are ---------- (weakened)

**Attenuation Model** (Treisman, 1964):

- attenuator analyzes stimuli on the basis of:
- physical characteristics
- language (syllables, words)
- meaning

![Treisman’s Attenuation Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-04.png)

- further processing occurs if information meets **------- recognition threshold** in the “dictionary unit”

e.g., common words, high importance (your name or “Help!”), relevance/expectations (words that fit the current context)

- problem:

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) MacKay (1973):

- attended ear presented with sentence: “They threw stones toward the bank yesterday.”
- non-attended ear presented with words including “-----” or “-----”
- recognition task: 4.2% more likely to (incorrectly) recognize: “They threw stones toward the savings and loan association yesterday.” despite no memory for hearing “-----”
- information from unattended ear processed to the level of meaning; implies -late- selection

**---- Selection Models** (Deutsch & Deutsch, 1963; Norman, 1968):

- stimuli are filtered after processing based on their physical properties and meaning
- selection based on importance of recognized item, or meaning
- memory processes devoted to selected inputs

![Late Selection Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-05.png)

- problem:

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) unlikely that all incoming stimuli are processed by deep semantic analysis

## Early or Late Selection?

Johnston & Wilson (1980):

- participants heard word pairs, one of which was occasionally a word from a target category (e.g., animals)
- target words were -------- (e.g., “bear”)
- simultaneously paired nontarget word was:
- appropriate (e.g., “---------”)
- inappropriate (e.g., “-----”)
- or neutral (e.g., “luck”)
- ------- attention: observers not told which ear would get the target
- detection of targets improved with appropriate nontargets
- worse with inappropriate
- ------- (selective) attention: observers told which ear the target would appear in
- nontargets had no effect on target detection

![Johnston & Wilson graph](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-06.png)

- amount of attention given to ---------- was as much as needed to accomplish the task

**--------- Theory** (Johnston & Heinz, 1978):

- there may be ---------- filters (preattentive and attentive)
- to minimize demands on capacity, early selection may occur, filtering out unnecessary stimuli (--------- attention)
- to evaluate a broad range of incoming information, late selection may occur (------- attention)

## Visual Attention

**------- ----------- Theory** (Treisman, 1986; Treisman & Gelade, 1980)

- Anne Treisman (b.1935, d.2018) won the 2009 Grawemeyer Award in Psychology, and received the 2011 US National Medal of Science
- attention must be focused on particular stimulus attributes or parts in space to construct a representation or percept

1. **------------ stage**:

- rapid, automatic decomposition of stimulus into a number of basic properties (“primitives”)
- processing is in parallel

2. **------- attention stage**:

- serial process
- spatial location selected, and primitives existing at this spot are combined

e.g., redness and X shape combined into red X

- combination object is called ------ ----; only exists temporarily to be examined by focused attention

Visual search:

- primitives determined via **visual search** experiments:
- task: find target among nontargets/“distractors”
- observers asked whether a display contains target
- RT (& errors) are recorded
- types of visual search:
- **------- search**: target defined by one basic property/primitive

e.g., find a green 2 among red 2s

![feature search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-07.png)

- **----------- search**: target defined by a combination of two or more basic properties/primitives

e.g., find a green 5 among green and red 2s, and red 5s

![conjunction search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-08.png)

- **spatial configuration search**: target defined by arrangement of features

e.g., find a 5 among 2s

![spatial configuration search](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s05-09.png)

- “**-------**”: time needed to find the target is very short/constant
- RT not influenced by number of distractors
- primitives cause pop-out in feature search:

e.g., colour, brightness, orientation, length, curvature, etc.

Pros & cons:

![☑](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/pro-new.png) evidence: **-------- conjunctions** (conjunction errors): when attention is overtaxed, primitives may be incorrectly combined

e.g., red Xs, blue Os: you may perceive a blue X

e.g., Stroop effect (1935): shows attentional inhibition of automatic cognitive processes

![☑](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/pro-new.png) evidence: **feature present/feature absent effect**: target features that are present are better detected than target features that are absent (Treisman & Souther, 1985)

![☑](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/pro-new.png) explains **-------**: how separate aspects of a stimulus (colour, form, motion, location) are combined into a holistic percept

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) contrary evidence: Schneider & Shiffrin (1977)

- visual search task
- different-category: scan for a certain number in a field of letters
- same-category: scan for a certain letter in a field of letters
- same-category: took longer, more errors
- however, with enough practice, participants could automatically discriminate:
- arbitrary groups of letters
- real letters vs. artificial letters
- regular vs. mirror-image letters
- with practice, conjunction search can become automatic/----------contrary to FIT

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Attention-files/con-new.png) attention is more than just a binding agent

Application of visual search (Wolfe & colleagues, 2005):

- when targets in visual search are rare, do ------ increase?

e.g., radiological screening for breast cancer, or airport baggage screening

- experiment simulated baggage screening: search images for targets (tools)

a) 20 in 40 images had target: miss rate = 7%; ------ RTs

b) 20 in 2000 images had target: miss rate = 30%; ------ RTs

- repeated negative responses (“no, no, no,...”) lead to speed/accuracy trade-off: repeated responses are faster, but produced more misses
- **the ---------- effect**: “if you don’t find it often, you often don’t find it”
- are the results the same in the real world, with real baggage screeners?

## Inattention

**Inattentional ---------**: if stimulus is presented, but is not -attended-, it is not perceived (coined by Mack & Rock, 1998; a.k.a. “looked-but-didn’t-see” problem)

Neisser (1979):

- showed videos of two overlapping basketball teams
- task: count the number of passes made by black-shirted team
- about 50% of viewers ------- the -----

Simons & Chabris (1999):

- showed participants a video of two teams of three basketball players
- task: count how many times the players wearing white pass the basketball
- 46% of observers ------ the -------

**Attentional -----**: when stimuli are presented in a series, one target stimulus interferes with the ability to detect a subsequent target

Shapiro, Arnell, & Raymond (1997):

- used rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)
- a string of stimuli presented briefly (100 ms each)
- first target stimulus is presented (e.g., white letter)
- second target stimulus follows (e.g., “X”)
- second target unlikely to be --------
- may be due to attention being “used up” for 500 ms after an event

**------ blindness**: an inability to detect changes in an object or a scene

Levin & Simons (1997):

- participants told to “pay close attention” to a video of a conversation
- only 1 of 10 participants noticed any -------

Simons & Levin (1998):

- only ---- of the participants noticed a change in the stranger
- changes may be local or global, fast or slow
- however, people -do- notice changed sex, race, or social group

Implications:

- attention is limited: ------- awareness
- not everything presented to our senses is ---------
- visual encoding must be ------
