## The Psychology of Everyday Things

Some things are ==easy== to use

e.g., using a pen, reading a book

Some things are ==not==

e.g., flying an Airbus A380, using doors

Why are some things easier to use than others?

- ==Simplicity==
- better ==design==!

Worst case of bad design: **==revenge== effects** (Tenner, 1996): unforeseen, ironic, and unintended consequences of complex systems

e.g., arthritic hands cannot open ==child==-proof bottles of pain reliever

(solution: “==easy==-open” bottles)

- not the same thing as trade-offs or side effects, which are known in advance and don’t -prevent- use

How can we avoid revenge effects--think of everything?

Who can help in the design of things that are understandable and usable?

**Human factors psychology**:

- the design of equipment and systems that people use--intentionally taking into account human perception, cognition, and behaviour
- also called **==ergonomics==** (Greek): -ergo- (“work”) and -nomos- (“laws”), coined by Jastrzębowski (1857)
- or **cognitive ==engineering==**: applies knowledge of cognitive psychology to the design and operation of human-machine systems

---

## The Systems Approach

1. **Physical ==Ergonomics==**: the immediate environment

- research field: **==anthropometry==** (measurement of human physical variation)
- design of displays, controls, etc.

2. **==Individual== Behaviour**: the actor

- research field: psychology
- ultimate “cause” of errors (i.e., ==blame==)
- affected by memory, biases, heuristics

3. **Interpersonal, Team, & Group Behaviour**: ==group== dynamics

- research fields: social psychology, sociology
- teams work cooperatively toward a common goal (groups merely have something in common with other members)
- diffusion of responsibility decreases reliability of group
- affected by decision-making factors like ==groupthink==

4. **Organizational & Management Behaviour**: the structure of ==supervision==

- research field: industrial/organizational (“I/O”) psychology, management theory
- create ==policy==, which affects entire organization
- responsible for development of ==safety== culture

5. **==Legal== & Regulatory Rules**: what is allowed/acceptable

- research field: legal scholars, governments?
- restrict what can/cannot be done, via laws

6. **Societal & Cultural Pressures**: the socio-cultural context

- research fields: cultural anthropology, sociology, economics, political science
- affected by economic and political pressures, cultural beliefs

Also consider ==interactions== among components.

## Case Study: Antibiotic Resistance

1. **Physical Level**

Bacteria

- Louis Pasteur (1862): French chemist
- illness not caused by bad air (“miasma”)
- bacteria cause infections
- demonstrated that germs did not spontaneously generate
- single-cell organisms found naturally on skin, in mucous membranes, and lining of intestinal tract ==(resident)== flora)
- unknown how many kinds there are
- may be aerobic, or anaerobic (do not require oxygen)
- there are over 300 kinds in your ==mouth== alone
- in/on your body, there are about as many bacteria as there are ==human== cells

Antibiotics

- Alexander Fleming (1928): discovered that bacteria did not survive on plate ==contaminated== by bread mould
- penicillin widely available by early 1940s
- modern ==antibiotics==:
- bacteriostatic: inhibit growth, allowing host to generate an immune response
- bacteriocidal: kill bacteria
- mechanisms: attack outer wall or inner membrane, or attack chemical pathways necessary for bacteria to survive and multiply
- 15 groups of antibiotics

e.g., group IV (macrolides and lincosamines) includes azithromycin (Zithromax®) and clarithromycin (Biaxin®); group IX (glycopeptides) includes vancomycin (Vancocin®)

Antibiotic Resistance

- bacteria constantly mutate
- an antibiotic may kill most--but not all--pathogenic bacteria
- survivors have resistance genes: “---------”; will propagate and be transmitted
- microbiome (beneficial resident bacteria which compete with pathogens) also affected
- resistance can be transferred via DNA, plasmids, or viruses
- common resistant strains:
- methicillin-resistant -Staphylococcus aureus- (MRSA)
- vancomycin-resistant -Enterococci- (VRE)
- penicillin-resistant -Streptococcus pneumoniae- (PRSP)
- use of antibiotics is a major cause of resistance (“the antibiotic -------”)
- is a serious problem (CCA, 2019)
- 26% of bacterial infections in Canada are resistant to first-line antibiotics
- in 2018, there were 250,000 resistant bacterial infections in Canada, and more than 5,400 deaths
- antibiotic resistance costs the Canadian health care system $1.4B/year

Environment

- 50-70% of antibiotic use in U.S. is in -----------
- >75% in Canada (since 2018, antibiotics for livestock require a prescription)
- excreted residues can spread into soil and water supplies, fostering resistant bacterial strains
- trace quantities found in ----- supplies in North America and Europe

2. **Individual Level**

- most respiratory tract infections caused by viruses (however, viral infection can lead to a secondary bacterial infection)
- 54% of adults believe antibiotics are effective against viral infections (they are not; NIPA, 2000)

3. **Interpersonal, Team, & Group Behaviour**

- physicians blamed for over-prescription of antibiotics
- about 33% of 150 million outpatient antibiotic prescriptions are ----------- (Levy, 1998)
- culture to test for bacterial infection takes 2 days
- if refused prescription for antibiotics, 11% of patients would see another physician

4. **Organizational Level**

- lack of public awareness of best practices/consequences
- physicians’ non-compliance with clinical guidelines

5. **Legal & Regulatory Level**

- most antibiotics used in livestock production are similar to those used in humans
- easy to get: many are over-the-counter, do not require vet’s prescription

6. **Societal & Cultural Level**

- people expect instant remedies for medical problems

## Solutions

1. **Physical Level**

- -------- and development into new antibiotics must continue

2. **Individual Level**

- do not seek antibiotics unless actually required
- finish taking all prescribed antibiotics
- change your behaviours to avoid infections
- do not touch the ------ (eyes, nose, mouth)
- wear a mask
- cover your cough: cough and sneeze into your --------, not your hands
- wash your hands (80% of common infections spread by hands)

1. use warm water and soap (-not- ------------- soap)
2. rub hands for 20 seconds (“Twinkle twinkle” song)
3. rinse for 10 seconds
4. dry with a towel
5. use towel to turn off taps, open door
3. **Interpersonal, Team, & Group Behaviour**

- do not demand antibiotics from physician (reduction in antibiotic prescriptions reduced/almost eliminated resistant Strep in Japan, Finland, & Iceland)

4. **Organizational Level**

- public education campaigns like Do bugs need drugs? (Alberta Health Services, 2000), Be Antibiotics Aware (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019), and Antibiotic Awareness Week
- clinical practice guidelines established by Alberta Medical Association, Canadian Medical Association, etc.
- National Information Program on Antibiotics (1996)
- Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics (1981)

5. **Legal and Regulatory Level**

- pass ---- to restrict use of antibiotics in agriculture

6. **Societal & Cultural Level**

- change --------- and social norms about antibiotics drug use
- increase cost of antibiotics

## Challenges

Challenges to human factors psychology (Landauer, 2003; Kadir et al., 2019):

- -------- theories studied, instead of concrete applications
- subtle psychological effects have been most studied; more information on robust effects needed
- principles of cognition rarely influence machine ------
- --------- are largely unaware of cognitive principles
- more empirical evidence needed from ---------- settings (e.g., workplaces, industry, etc.)
- research should be more --------, including all levels of the systems approach
