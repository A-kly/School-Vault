- processes that operate on knowledge
- may also refer to the knowledge itself

## The Modal Model

(Richard Atkinson & Richard Shiffrin, 1968, 1971)

- **Structural features**: stable memory stores
	- **sensory store**
	- **short-term store** (STS) represented acoustically
	- **long-term store** (LTS) is semantic
	- based on James’ (1890) primary and secondary memory
	- this distinction is similar to computers (RAM vs. hard drive)

![Modal Model](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-01.png)

- **control processes**: routines or strategies a person selects and uses depending on the situation; they include:
	- **rehearsal**: repetition of information; helps transfer information from STS to LTS
		- e.g., repeating a phone number over and over until you memorize it
	- **coding**: associating to-be-remembered information with already known information
		- e.g., imaging: using visual images to remember verbal information
	- **retrieval strategies**: help focus on to-be-remembered information
		- e.g., remembering provincial capitals by starting with the west coast and working eastward

Pros & cons:
- [p] division of memory is clear and intuitive
- [p] influential in guiding memory research
- [c] oversimplified structures and processes of memory
- [c] overstated the role of rehearsal in remembering

## Sensory Store

- George Sperling (1960): What is the duration of the sensory store?
	- Part I: ==whole== report method
		- flashed matrix of letters on screen for 50 ms
		- recall rate was 4.5 out of a 12-letter matrix (38%)
	- Part II: ------- report method
		- matrix flashed on screen
		- delay
		- cue tone presented, indicating which row should be recalled
		- brief delay: tested recall for desired row was 3.3 out of 4 (82%)
		- accuracy declined as delay period increased
		- implied complete image was temporarily stored
		- “**------ -----**” duration ~200-400 ms
		- same result if cued to ------, when coloured letters were scattered in a matrix

- Darwin, Turvey, & Crowder (1972):
	- three-------person task:

| **left ear:** | **both ears:** | **right ear:** |
| ------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| B             | 8              | F              |
| 2             | 6              | R              |
| L             | U              | 10             |

- partial report cue: visual bar on left, middle, or right
- longer delay: poorer recall
- “------ -----” duration ~2-4 s

Sensory stores also exist for touch, smell, and taste

Function: allows extraction of limited amounts of information to ---

## Short-Term Store

### STS Capacity

George Miller (1956):

- **---------- task**: try to recall a given a list of numbers
- capacity: “The Magical Number -----, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information”

However, more recent work (Baddeley, 1994; Cowan, 2001) indicates that STS capacity is four, plus or minus one.

STS unit is a **-----**: well-learned unit of components, representing consistent or meaningful pattern

- **chunking** combines units into a larger chunk, and reduces amount to be remembered
- application: --------

e.g., “Roy G. Biv” tells you the colours of the rainbow

Chase & Simon (1973): How are expertise and STS related?

- participants: chess masters, intermediates, novices
- shown chess boards for 5 s:
- ------ chess boards: masters’ recall superior
- ------ pieces: equal performance
- experts have better -domain---------- memories of patterns that form chunks

Chase & Ericsson (1981):

- trained long-distance ------ S.F. to expand digit span using chunking

e.g., sequence 3 4 9 2 would be encoded as 3 min 49.2 s (near world-record time for the mile)

- expanded digit span from 7 to 79 digits with 230 hours of practice

![S.F.’s digit span](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-02.png)

### STS Duration

Peterson & Peterson (1959; also Brown, 1958): How long is short-term storage?

- participants told to remember 3 consonants & 3-digit number
- during retention interval, had to count backwards by 3s

e.g. given “S B J, 394”, count 391, 388, 385,...

- after a certain amount of time, recall the 3 letters

![decrease in STS over time](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-03.png)

- their conclusion: STS ------ in less than 20 seconds without active rehearsal

Problem:

Keppel & Underwood (1962):

- performance declined over trials
- previously used letters ---------- with current memory!

### Decay vs. Interference

Waugh & Norman (1965)

- list of 16 digits (last = “probe digit”), then a tone
- what digit came after the probe the first time it occurred in the list?

e.g., 7 9 5 1 2 9 3 8 0 4 6 3 7 6 0 2 (tone), respond: “9”

- presentation rate of 1/s or 4/s
- decay prediction: less recall with slower rate
- interference prediction: no difference due to rate
- results: presentation rate had little effect on recall

![interference effect in STS](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-04.png)

- conclusion: interference, not decay, is the primary cause of forgetting
- **----------- interference**: new information replaces older information

e.g., Windows 3.1 paste command was...?

- **--------- interference**: already-learned information makes it harder to remember new information

e.g., Power 92.5 FM now called...?

Barnes & Underwood (1959):

- participants learned a list of paired-associate words until perfect recall (A-B list)

e.g., -chair-dog-

- then learned a second list with the first terms paired with new words (A-C list)

e.g., -chair-tree-

(studied this second list 1, 5, 10, or 20 times)

- memory was tested for both associated terms

e.g., given -chair-, respond with -dog- and -tree-

![retroactive interference](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-05.png)

- recall of A-B list is interfered with by the memory for A-C list (----------- interference)

Wickens, Born & Allen (1963):

- participants heard several lists of words from same category

(dogs)

- recall declined after a number of trials
- on the final trial, words were from a different category

(flowers)

- recall --------
- **------- from proactive interference**

### STS Coding

Acoustic:

- **------------ similarity effect** (Conrad, 1964):
- letters were presented --------
- participants then wrote them down
- more interference among similar-sounding letters

(e.g., B C P T V vs. F M N S X)

- 75% of errors from same acoustical class
- few visual errors

(e.g., E vs. F, O vs. Q, R vs. P)

- **---- ------ effect** memory for shorter words is better than for longer words

e.g., digit spans for different languages (Naveh-Benjamin & Ayres, 1986):

![digit span as a function of language](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-06.png)

- this effect is a function of how long it takes to read the words out loud
- **articulatory -----------**: repeating word (e.g., “the”) during retention interferes with memory

Visual:

Posner & Keele (1967):

- showed letters, same or different in name and/or form:

e.g., AA, Aa, AB, or Ab

- measured RT to decide same name:

e.g., AA (same), Aa (same), AB (different)

- took longer to decide same name/different form (Aa) than same name/same form (AA)
- implies ------ code in STS

Brooks (1968): ------------ effects

Tasks:

- sentence: read a sentence, then from memory, make judgments about each word (is it a noun?)
- diagram: see block letter, then from memory, go around it clockwise and make judgments about each corner (is it at the ------- top or bottom of the letter?)

Response modes:

- verbal: say “yes” or “no”
- pointing at spatial arrangement of Ys and Ns

e.g., sentence task with verbal response mode:

“A bird in the hand is not in the bush.” Is each word a ----?

(correct sequence: N, Y, N, N, Y, N, N, N, N, Y)

e.g., diagram task with pointing response mode:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|***L**|||Y|N||
|Y|||N|
||Y|N||
|Y|||N|
||Y|N||
|Y|||N|

(correct sequence: Y, Y, Y, N, N, Y)

Results (time in seconds):

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Response mode:**|   |
|**Task:**|**verbal**|**pointing**|
|sentence|13.8|9.8|
|diagram|11.3|28.2|

- spatial response mode (pointing) ---------- with imagery (diagram task)

Semantic: Shulman (1970):

- participants viewed 10-word lists
- given recognition test using visually represented “probe words”:
- -------- (e.g. “bawl” for “ball”)
- -------- (e.g. “talk” for “speak”)
- identical to the original word
- homonym and synonym probes produced similar error rates, suggesting an equal amount of acoustic and -------- coding in STS

## Working Memory

Alan Baddeley (1974, 1976, 2000, 2018):

In contrast to the storage-based view of STS, working memory includes the processing of information

Components:

- **------------ loop**:
- phonological store: passively stores speech sounds
- articulatory rehearsal process: actively processes items to prevent decay
- **------------ sketchpad**:
- visual cache: stores form and colour information
- inner scribe: handles spatial and movement information; rehearses visual information; also transfers information in visual cache to central executive
- **------- ---------**:
- controls attention
- coordinates other components
- transfers information to/from long-term memory
- time sharing of multiple tasks

e.g., generating random numbers is worse while alternating reciting alphabet and counting

- **-------- buffer**:
- interfaces with episodic long-term memory storage (holds personal life experiences)
- integrates information into a single complex structure or experience

![working memory](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-07.png)

General:

- fluid systems include attention and temporary storage, whereas crystallized systems accumulate long-term ---------
- all components have limited --------
- if two tasks use the same component, they cannot be performed successfully --------

Pros & cons:

![☑](PSYCH%20258-%20Short-Term%20&%20Working%20Memory-files/pro-new.png) conceptualizes active processing and transient storage of information

![☑](PSYCH%20258-%20Short-Term%20&%20Working%20Memory-files/pro-new.png) can be applied to ------- tasks

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Short-Term%20&%20Working%20Memory-files/con-new.png) role of central executive is vague

![☒](PSYCH%20258-%20Short-Term%20&%20Working%20Memory-files/con-new.png) it is unclear how components interact

Smith & Jonides (1997): How is working memory related to the brain?

- participants given verbal memory or spatial memory task while in a PET scanner
- verbal task: presented 4 target letters; delay; probe letter presented: Did probe match any target letter?
- spatial task: presented 3 dots at different locations; delay; circle presented: Was a dot located within the circle?

![diagram of verbal and spatial tasks](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-08.png)

- brain activation from a related control task not requiring working memory was ----------
- results:
- verbal task: activated posterior parietal, Broca’s, premotor, and supplementary motor areas in left hemisphere

![left hemisphere activation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-09.png)

- spatial task: activated posterior parietal and premotor areas in right hemisphere

![left hemisphere activation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s06-10.png)

- conclusions:
- ------------------- evidence for different systems for verbal (left hemisphere) vs. spatial information (right hemisphere)
- as memory load increased, corresponding brain regions showed increase in activity
- may be -------- components for passive storage (generally located toward the back of the brain) vs. active processing (more in the frontal lobes)

Other research has implicated the central executive as a function of the ---------- cortex, whereas the episodic buffer seems more broadly distributed.
