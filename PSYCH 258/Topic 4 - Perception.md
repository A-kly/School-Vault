## What is Perception?

- can be defined in terms of ==sensory== processes, like receptor activation and neural firing
- or in terms of ==mental== activity that mediates between sensation and awareness, interpreting what our senses tell us

**Sensation**:

- process of ==encoding== energy or chemicals in the environment in terms of neural signals
- a basic experience elicited by a simple stimulus
- more concerned with your own physical ==experience==

e.g., feeling of ==warmth== on your skin

**Perception**:

- organization and interpretation of neural signals, making them ==meaningful==
- more complex experiences produced by integrating sensations
- more concerned with ==identifying== the stimulus

e.g., you see a hot ==stove== element, producing heat you feel; you know it is X cm away, and it can burn you

---

## Bottom-Up vs. Top-Down Processing

- **bottom-up** (**data -driven**) **processing**: low-level stimulus data from receptors is processed; may be combined to form patterns
	- e.g., representation created via Gestalt laws

- **top-down** (**conceptually driven**) **processing**: higher-level cognitive processes like memories, beliefs, or expectations affect interpretations of (possibly ambiguous) stimulus input gathered by the senses
	- e.g., may guide where to look or what to look for

	- Biederman (1981):
		- observers cued to a location on a screen
		- scene then presented on screen
		- task: identify object at cued location
		- result: observers did ==worse== identifying familiar items in an impossible location than in an unlikely location or normal location
			- e.g., fire hydrant on top of mailbox vs. on lunch counter vs. on street

![fire hydrant on top of mailbox](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-01.png) ![fire hydrant on lunch counter](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-02.png) ![fire hydrant on street](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-03.png)

- conclusion: ==conceptual== knowledge of context influences perception

Palmer (1975):
- observers shown contextual scene of a kitchen
- then target object presented: a) loaf of bread, b) mailbox, or c) drum (none appeared in scene; only bread “belonged”)

![Palmer (1975)](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-04.png)

- task: identify target object
- result: identification performance was best for the loaf of bread
- ==context== leads you to expect certain things to fit in, and can enhance performance

Coren, Porac, & Ward (1978): individual differences
- presented ambiguous doodle-like figures:

![ambiguous doodles](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-05.png)

- interpreted differently by males vs. females
	- a) Males: brush, centipede; Females: comb, teeth
	- b) males: target; females: dinner plate
	- c) males: head; females: cup

Balance needed between top-down and bottom-up processing:

- only top-down ==> see only what you ==want== to see--*even if it differs from reality*!?
- only bottom-up ==> you can’t use anything you’ve ==learned== about the (perceptual) world

---

## Gestalt Psychology

- basis: ==movement== could be produced by a succession of stationary stimuli (Max Wertheimer, 1912)
- motto: “the ==whole== is different than the sum of its parts”

### Figure-Ground Segregation

e.g., Rubin figure (1915):

![ambiguous figure](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-06.png)

Generally, figures:

- appear to be in ==front==
- are smaller
- have well-defined ==shapes==
- are meaningful
- have more detail
- differ from background in brightness

### Laws of Perceptual Organization

- **---------**/**nearness**: things near to each other tend to be grouped together

![proximity](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-07.png)

- **----------**: similar things tend to be grouped together

![similarity](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-08.png)

- **---- ------------**: points that, if connected, would result in either straight or smoothly curving lines, tend to be seen as belonging together

![good continuation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-09.png)

- **closure**: a space enclosed by a contour (real or illusory) tends to appear as a figure

![closure](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-10.png)   ![Kanizsa triangle](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-11.png)

- **------ ----**: things that are moving in the same direction tend to be grouped together

![common fate](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-12.gif)

- **meaningfulness**/**familiarity**: things that are meaningful or familiar tend to form groups

![meaningfulness](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-13.png)

- **law of  pragnanz** (“good figure” or “simplicity”): every stimulus pattern is seen in such a way that the resulting structure is as simple as possible

![Prägnanz](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-14.png)

Pros & cons:
- [p]  holistic approach
- [c] operates -post hoc-; not good for predictions
- [c] not good at explanations
- [c] vague definitions: “simplicity”?

---

## Object Perception

- **recognition**: perceiving something as previously encountered
	- Yes or no question
- **identification**: naming or classifying an object

- **Template-matching models**
	- assumptions:
		- represented as holistic, unanalyzed unit (template)
		- input pattern compared to stored representations
		- stimulus categorized by exact match
	- pros & cons:
		- [p] successfully used by machines
			-  e.g., MICR numbers on cheques, barcodes
		- [c] requires all-or-none judgment; intolerant to ==variations==:
			-  ![letter As](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-15.png)
		- [c] too many templates required
		- [c] cannot handle ==context==:
			- ![context effect](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-16.png)
		- [c] cannot handle ==novel== stimuli

- **Distinctive-features models**
	- assumptions:
	- represented as list of features
	- inputs analyzed into small list of constituent features
	- identity determined by selecting feature list most similar to input
	- **pandemonium** (Selfridge, 1959)
		- Stage 1: “==Image== Demon”
			- gets sensory input
			- e.g., **R**
		- Stage 2: “==Feature== Demons”
			- analyze input in terms of features
			- e.g., 
		- Stage 3: “==cognitive== Demons”
			- determine which groups of features are present; each activated by several particular features
			- e.g, **P R T** more than **A** or **X**
		- Stage 4: “-------- Demon”
			- identifies the pattern by listening for the Cognitive Demon shouting loudest
			- e.g., **R**
	- pros & cons:
		- [p] evidence:
			- Hubel & Wiesel (1962): visual ==feature== detectors
			- Gibson, Schapiro, & Yonas (1968):
				- “Are letters same or different?”
					- G vs. W, RT = 458 ms
					- P vs. R, RT = 571 ms
		- [p] can identify wide range of stimuli--just specify component ==features==
		- [c] doesn’t define “feature”: single line segment? two lines forming an angle? curved line?
		- [c] cannot handle Gestalt organizational principles: when is a row of dots a line?
		- [c] cannot handle ==context==
		- [c] what about real-life/3-D objects?

## Structural Theories

**Recognition (he means identification) by Components** (Biederman, 1987)
- assumptions:
	- visual scene can be decomposed into a constant set of basic elements: “**geons**” (geometric icons): 36 basic volumetric shapes that can be modified (length, width, etc.), yet remain identifiable (cylinder, brick, cone):

![geons](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-18.png)

- **Principle of ==componential recovery==**: if object’s geons can be determined, then it can be identified--even if object is partially obscured
- pros & cons:
	- [p] has well-defined features
	- [p] can handle variation, novel stimuli
	- [c] cannot handle context
	- [c] may be too broad--objects also differ in their -------

## Visual Agnosia

- from Greek, meaning “without knowledge”
- failure or deficit in perceiving or identifying objects (Freud, 1891)

e.g., **-------------**: disruption of face perception; inability to recognize/identify friends and family; inability to read facial expressions/emotions

- may not be able to determine stimulus is a face
- or may have intact perception of facial features but no holistic face perception

Categories of agnosias (Lissauer, 1890):

- **------------**: failure to form a holistic percept; deficit in perception of whole objects
- inability to extract global structure, despite intact low-level sensory processing (acuity, colour, and brightness discrimination intact)
- cannot identify, discriminate, or copy complex visual forms, like ------
- but they can grasp objects they cannot identify
- a.k.a. **visual form agnosia**, or **visual space agnosia**
- **-----------**: deficit in associating pattern with meaning (“recognition without meaning”)
- cannot draw from memory
- able to copy and draw pictures, but cannot identify them
- can use other senses (e.g., touch, smell)

e.g., **visual ------ agnosia**: “convoluted red form with a linear green attachment” = ---- (Sacks, 1970)

Specific agnosias (Farah, 2004):

- **-------- specific** (or **semantic**) agnosia: inability to identify living (or nonliving) objects, metals, fruit, vegetables, musical instruments, fabrics, and/or gemstones
- **-------- syndrome**:
- inability to perceive more than one aspect of a visual stimulus, or integrate details into a coherent whole

e.g., “a man...and mountains” = scene of ----- (Tyler, 1968)

- person can identify individual objects, but cannot tell where they are located, or reach for them

Two somewhat distinct visual pathways (Ungerleider & Mishkin, 1982):

![what vs. where pathways](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-19.jpg)

- **“----” pathway**
- concerned with object recognition and identification
- from occipital lobe to temporal lobe; a.k.a. **ventral pathway**
- **“-----” pathway**
- involved in locating objects, motion, spatial relationships, depth
- from occipital lobe to parietal lobe; a.k.a. **dorsal pathway**
- supported by **-------dissociation**: in one case study, one ability is functioning, but another ability is not; and vice-versa in another case study
- visual form agnosia: damaged “what” pathway, but intact “where” pathway
- Bálint’s syndrome: intact “what” pathway, but damaged “where” pathway

Milner & Goodale (1996):

- patient D.F. (“Diane”) had CO poisoning, which led to brain damage and visual form agnosia: unable to discriminate object identity, shape, orientation
- cannot identify or draw an apple or a book by looking at them--but can draw them from memory or idenfity objects by holding them
- can perceive colours and textures

e.g., she can identify a banana from its yellow colour and texture of its surface)

- to her own --------, she can accurately reach and grasp objects

e.g., can reach out to appropriately grasp a banana

- tested on two similar, but different tasks:
- ----------- matching: “Hold the card at the same slant as the slot”; D.F. much worse than a control participant

![orientation matching results](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-20.png)

- visuomotor -------: “Put the card into the slot”; D.F. about the same as a control participant (intact dorsal stream)

![visuomotor posting results](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s04-21.png)

- damaged “what” system, but intact “---” system (i.e., not just “where”, but -how- to interact with objects in space)

Implications:

- detecting visual features is critical in constructing a -------
- perceiving features of a visual stimulus is separate from higher-level processing
- connecting ------- with a visual pattern is a separate step
- there are multiple visual pathways that handle perception and action
