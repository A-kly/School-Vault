## The Serial Position Effect

Glanzer & Cunitz (1966):

- gave participants lists of words to remember
- results:

![serial position curve](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-01.png)

- **==primacy== effect**: better recall for items at beginning of list; greater rehearsal causes transfer to LTS
- **recency effect**: better recall of items at end of list, which were still in STS; mental math (recall delay) affected recency only

Problems:
- [c]  similarity of STS & LTS
	- coding: both use acoustic, visual, and semantic
	- forgetting: due to interference
- [c]  argument from parsimony
	- memory varies along a continuum (short--long)
	- why have different memory systems?
	- simpler to assume -one- memory system
- [c]  Craik & Watkins (1973): STS to LTS transfer
	- participants heard a list of items; had to remember last word starting with “g”
		- e.g., daughter, oil, rifle, garden, grain, table, football, anchor, giraffe
	- words differed in opportunities for rehearsal
		- e.g., -giraffe- value = 0; -grain- value = 4; -garden- value = 1
		- (number of opportunities for rehearsal)
	- participants did math task, then free recall of all words
- memory for “g” words:

![recall as a function of repetition](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-02.png)

- no advantage for greater ==rehersal==

- [c]  Bekerian & Baddeley (1980): role of repetition
	- BBC advertised new radio frequencies 10×/hour
	- casual listener exposed to message 1,000×
	- most listeners didn’t ==remember== the message
	- repetition ≠ retention

## Long-Term Store

### LTS Duration

(see next topic)

### LTS Capacity

- Von Neumann (1958):
	- calculation based on neural firing rate, estimated number of neurons, and a lifetime of 60 years
	- 2.8 × 1020 bits, or about 1 exabyte (1 billion gigabytes)
- Landauer (1986):
	- estimated “functional information content”: amount of information adults need to do normal tasks
	- compared rate of information processing vs. forgetting on a number of tasks
		- e.g., reading, pictures, nonsense syllables
	- people retain 2 bits/sec
	- conclusion: adult LTS contains 109 bits, or 125 megabytes
	- not the same as storage capacity
- Reber (2010):
	- the brain has ~100 billion neurons--but not all are involved in forming long-term memories
	- ~1 billion neurons likely participate in memory × ~1,000 synapses each = 1012 (1 trillion) total synapses
	- but each synapse does not store one memory
	- rather, memories are distributed across our brain’s neural networks, exponentially increasing capacity
	- memory capacity estimated to be 2.5 petabytes (2.5 million gigabytes)
	- bottom line: LTS capacity unknown; practically ==unlimited==

### LTS Coding

- Shulman (1972):
	- found that falsely recalled words had a similar meaning
	- e.g., “baby” for “infant”, or “ship” for “boat”
	- depended on position of list item: semantic confusions at ==start== (words in LTM), acoustic confusions at ==end== (words in STM)
	- words that were held in LTS were coded by meaning

---

## Types of Memories

- **==explicit== memory** (a.k.a. **declarative memory**): conscious, intentional remembering of knowledge or an event
	- Able to declare it in words, aka, "Ottawa is the capital of Canada"
- **==recall==**: reproducing previously encountered information from memory
	- Just remember it, nothing more, aka written essay exam
- **==recognition==**: identifying previously learned information
	- aka multiple choice exam
- **==implicit== memory** (a.k.a. **nondeclarative memory**): unconscious retention due to previous experience
	- eg. remembering a experience in it's entirety, muscle memory
- **repetition priming effect**: previous experience with a stimulus facilitates later response to the same (or similar) stimulus
	- e.g., word-fragment completion: fill in missing letters from a word: P--M-S--RE
		- (PERMASTORE)
	- e.g., word-stem completion: given the first few letters in a word, complete the word as fast as possible: “per...”

### Theory of Memory Systems

Endel Tulving (1972, 1985):

- **==episodic== memory**
	- memory for events that occurred in your life
	- tied to specific learning episode or experience
- **==semantic== memory**
	- stores words, concepts, rules, abstract ideas
	- general knowledge not tied to any experience
- **==procedural== memory**
	- underlies motor & cognitive skills
	- e.g., doing math, playing chess, riding a bike

![long-term memory](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-03.jpg)

Evidence:
- certain patients with amnesia may have damaged one kind of memory system but have other ones intact (this is a **==dissociation== effect**: one specific ability is affected, but another is not)
- **==retrograde== amnesia**: inability to remember events that occurred -before- a traumatic event
- **==anterograde== amnesia**: inability to form new memories of events that occurred -after- a traumatic event

The case of patient H.M. (Scoville & Milner, 1957; Corkin, 2013):
- had progressive uncontrolled epilepsy since age 10
- to control his seizures, had bilateral medial temporal lobe (MTL) resection at age 27 (in 1953)
- ==hippocampus==,  parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala removed
- surgery was successful (fewer seizures), but resulted in profound amnesia
- normal IQ, STS (e.g., digit span), language (speech, writing, and reading)
- could remember events/facts in his distant past, but had temporally graded retrograde amnesia for events 11 years before the surgery
- could not learn new facts or remember information about events since his surgery:
	- could not find new home, even after 10 months
	- language frozen in the 1950s
	- forgot who he was talking to if he turned away
	- however, he could form new ==procedural== memories (e.g., mirror tracing task), but had no conscious recollection of previous training episodes
	- see also -Memory’s Ghost: The Strange Tale of Mr. M. and the Nature of Memory- (Hilts, 1995) and -Permanent Present Tense: The Unforgettable Life of the Amnesic Patient, H.M.- (Corkin, 2013)

The case of patient K.C. (Moscovitch, Schacter, Tulving & colleagues, 2005):

- suffered a closed-head injury in a motorcycle collision in Toronto at age 30
- severe damage to MTLs and almost complete bilateral ==hippocampal== loss
- left-hemisphere lesions to posterior occipital-temporal and anterior frontal-parietal cortices
- personality changed from outgoing to more tranquil
- had retrograde amnesia for episodic memory, although ==semantic== knowledge was intact
- also had some anterograde amnesia: no episodic memories formed after the accident (**==episodic== amnesia**)
- but could form new semantic and procedural memories:
	- played chess but did not remember playing a game
	- knew where family cottage was but did not remember ever going there
	- learned the Dewey decimal system for his job at the library, but did not know when he learned it

Conclusions:

- unimpaired STS implies it is biologically ==different== from LTS
- hippocampus (and MTL?) not a storage site, but important for ==consolidation== of explicit memories (STS to LTS transfer)
- H.M. provides evidence that implicit memory is ==dissociated== from explicit memory
- K.C. provides evidence that, within ==explicit== memory, semantic memory is dissociated from episodic memory

## Encoding

**Levels of Processing Theory** (Fergus I.M. Craik & Lockhart, 1972):

- Encoding processes:
	- **shallow** (e.g., ==structural:== based on appearance of a word)
	- **intermediate** (e.g., ==phonemic:== based on sound of a word)
	- **deep** (e.g., ==semantic==: based on meaning of a word)

- “Deeper” encoding enhances memory. Why?
	- **==maintenance== rehearsal**: repetitive processing
		- e.g., repeating a phone number over and over
	- **==elaborative== rehearsal**: more meaningful processing, relating item to other knowledge
		- e.g., grouping digits in a phone number into meaningful patterns
		- may work by organizing, connecting, or integrating memories (Bellezza et al., 1977; Mandler, 1979)

- Evidence:
	- Craik & Tulving (1975):
		- participants given a list of words; asked to do one of three tasks:
		- case: Is the word in capital letters?
		- rhyme: Does the word rhyme with weight?
		- sentence: Does the word fit in this sentence: “He met a \_\_\_\_ in the street”?
		- measured recognition performance and latency on incidental (surprise) memory test

![recognition as a function of task type](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-04.png)         ![latency as a function of task type](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-05.png)

- is performance due to processing ==time==?
- structural task: Does word match this pattern of consonants and vowels?
	- e.g. CCVVC
- semantic task: Does word fit in this sentence?
	- e.g., “The man threw a ball to the \_\_\_\_\_.”
- results:

| **Task:**  | **Time** | **Recognition** |
| ---------- | -------- | --------------- |
| structural | 1.70 s   | 57%             |
| semantic   | 0.83 s   | 82%             |
- depth of processing more important than processing ==time==

Problems:

- [c]  What does "deeper" mean?
	- circular definition: deeper -> better memory

- [c]  Morris, Bransford, & Franks (1977): marching encoding and retrieval
	- encoding task: given the word -table-
	- phonetic/rhyming: Does it rhyme with -cable-?
	- semantic: Does it fit in this sentence?
		- “Put the dish on the \_\_\_\_\_.”
- incidental recognition tests:
	- phonetic/rhyming: Circle what rhymes with word presented earlier:
		- Fable    Desk    Window
	- semantic: Circle word presented earlier:
		- Table    Desk    Window
- results:
 ![remembering as a function of encoding and retrieval](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-06.png)

- memory performance not dependent on depth alone
- also depends on ==match== between encoding processes and type of test

- [c]  Kapur, Craik, Tulving, & colleagues (1994):
	- shallow task: Does the word contain the letter -a- ?
	- deep task: Does word represent a living thing?
	- better recognition for deep task

![cortical activation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-07.png)

- greater activation in left inferior ==prefrontal== cortex during a deep task
	- shows -*more*- activity, not -*deeper*- activity

### Other Encoding Factors

**==self-reference== effect** (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977): memory is enhanced by relating items to one’s self
- presented 40 adjectives to participants
	- e.g., -*kind*-, -*rigid*-, -*brave*-, etc.

- words evaluated one of four ways:
	- structural, phonemic, or semantic tasks
	- ==self-reference== group asked if each adjective described them
- results of incidental recall test:
![self-reference effect](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-08.png)
- self-reference group surpassed semantic encoding group

**==Generation== effect** (Mäntylä, 1986): memory is enhanced for items that are actively produced
- presented 600 nouns (e.g., -banana-, -freedom-, -tree-)
- task: generate 3 cue words associated with each noun (e.g., -yellow-, -bunches-, -edible- for -banana-)
- Gp1: generated cue words
- Gp2: saw the nouns, and the 3 cue words generated by other participants
- Gp3: just saw the 3 cue words generated by other participants
- results of incidental recall test of nouns:

![generation effect](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-09.png)

- self-generated cues lead to better remembering
- cues were most helpful when they were both ==compatible== with the target word and ==distinctive==

e.g., given the noun -*coat*-, the cue -*jacket*- is compatible and distinctive, but -*wool*- is not (it may cue other nouns like -*fabric*- and -*sheep*-)

---

## Retrieval

**Testing effect** (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006):

- stimuli: two prose passages from TOEFL prep book (~260 words each)
- learning conditions:
- study, study: 7 minutes of studying, retention interval, another 7 minutes of studying
- study, test: 7 minutes of studying, retention interval, 7 minutes of testing
- retention interval:
- 5 minutes, 2 days, or 1 week
- results:

![testing effect](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-10.png)

- conclusion: ==testing== (via retrieval practice) improves long-term retention

How does the testing effect work?

- additional (focused) presentation of material
- ==retrieval== itself is a memory modifier, with increasing retrieval demand/effort enhancing later retention
- processes applied during an initial test are also used during the final test, resulting in positive transfer (i.e., a ==practice== effect)

---

## Matching Encoding & Retrieval

**Encoding specificity principle**: if conditions at retrieval match those at encoding, memory is enhanced (Tulving & Thomson, 1973)

### External Cues

- **==context-dependent== memory**: memory enhancement that occurs when retrieval context matches encoding context

Godden & Baddeley (1975):

- scuba divers given a list of 36 unrelated words via diver underwater communication sets:

a) underwater, or b) on land

- recalled words in same (matched) or different (mismatched) context
- results:

![Godden & Baddeley (1975)](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-11.png)

- different contexts: 24% correct
- same context: 35% correct
- evidence for context-dependent memory
- strong ==implications== for scuba divers & remembering!

Context effects obtained for:

- music: Mozart vs. jazz vs. quiet (Smith, 1985)
- background colours (Dulsky, 1935)
- smell of ==chocolate== (Schab, 1990), but not unpleasant odours (Rotton, 1983)

Bjork & colleagues (1978):

- participants given a list of 40 four-letter nouns, studied in two sessions
- sessions were held in the same room ==twice==, or in two different rooms:
- context 1: small, cluttered, windowless room
- context 2: room in a modern building with windows overlooking a courtyard
- students were tested in a third, “neutral” room
- results:
- students who studied in the same room twice: 40% correct
- students who studied in two different rooms: 61% correct
- implication: studying in a variety of contexts leads to better remembering, greater stability and “==generalization==” of knowledge

### Internal States

- **==state-dependent== memory**: if internal state during retrieval matches that during encoding, memory may be enhanced
	- e.g., mood or emotional state, physiological arousal, sober/==drunk== states (Eich, 1980)

- **mood ==dependence==**: when mood at retrieval matches the mood at encoding, memory is facilitated--however, the memories themselves are typically not emotional in nature (Lewis & Critchley, 2003)
- **mood ==congruence==**: mood at retrieval influences the kind of memories retrieved
	- e.g., in a sad mood, you’re more likely to remember sad events

- implicated in vicious cycle of depression (Baddeley, 1993)

---

## Transfer of Information

**==Consolidation==**: process of integrating new information into stored knowledge

### Practice Effects

- savings curve (Ebbinghaus, 1885):
- more initial ==practice== -> less time to relearn list of nonsense syllables the next day (savings)

![Ebbinghaus (1885)](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-12.png)

- spacing effect (Bahrick, 1979):
- participants learned English translations for 50 Spanish words by completing six training sessions
- kinds of training:

- **==massed== practice**: information studied repeatedly at one time

- **==distributed== practice** (or **spaced repetition**): information studied repeatedly in separate sessions over a longer period of time

- independent variable: spacing gap
	- 0 days (massed practice)
	- 1 day (distributed practice)
	- 30 days (distributed practice)

- participants were given a final test 1 month after the last training session
- results:

![spacing effect](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-13.png)

- greater spacing between training sessions produced better remembering

- follow-up study 8 years later showed 30-day spacing group outperformed the other two (Bahrick & Phelps, 1987)

- **==spacing== effect**: distributed practice produces better remembering than massed practice
- why?

- **multiple ==encoding contexts== theory**: multiple study sessions lead to multiple types of encoding, thus greater chance of matching during test conditions

- **==REM== theory**: the more rapid eye movement sessions following study sessions, the more consolidation that occurs

Kornell & Bjork (2008): interleaved practice

- goal: identify painting styles of different artists by inductive learning (observing ==exemplars==)
- stimuli were multiple landscape paintings by relatively unfamiliar artists, including Henri-Edmond Cross, Marilyn Mylrea, and YeiMei
- independent variable was the nature of practice

-  ==blocked== practice: participants studied artists one at a time (e.g., 6 paintings by Cross presented consecutively, followed by 6 by Mylrea, etc.)

-  ==interleaved== practice: participants studied artists mixed up (e.g., 1 painting by Cross, then 1 by YeiMei, then 1 by Mylrea, etc.)

- both groups studied 6 paintings by each of 12 artists, then were tested with 4 previously unseen paintings each of the 12 artists
- results:
	-  blocked: 50% correct
	-  interleaved: ==65==% correct

- in one experiment, participants experienced both blocked and interleaved practice: 78% of participants did better with interleaved practice
- but when asked to rate practice effectiveness, ==78==% rated blocking as good as (or better than) interleaving
- conclusion: ==interleaving== enhances inductive learning of concepts and categories
- implications: even though it may seem less effective, to maximize learning of different concepts, multiple examples should be presented and practiced interleaved
- interleaving has been shown to work in basketball, baseball, identifying birds, electrocardiogram interpretation, learning microsurgery, and assessing complex legal scenarios
- may work by requiring the learner to differentiate among related concepts, or to retrieve the correct strategy for each different type of problem
- spaced vs. interleaved practice:
	- interleaving can be seen as a subtype of spacing

![spaced vs. massed diagram](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-14.png)

![interleaved vs. blocked diagram](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-15.png)

### REM/Sleep Effects

- David Hartley (1791) was the first to suggest ==dreaming== might alter the strength of associative memories
- ==REM== sleep was discovered by Aserinski & Kleitman (1953); linked it to dreaming
- REM sleep has been found to improve learning complex ==logic== games, foreign ==language== acquisition, visual discrimination tasks, and intensive --------
- may be due to ==synchronous== brain activity, neuronal replay, changes in ---------------, or regional brain activation (Stickgold, Hobson, Fosse, & Fosse, 2001)

Contradictory evidence (Siegel, 2001; Vertes & Eastman, 2000):

- results of animal studies are equivocal: REM deprivation does not necessarily impair learning/memory
- REM deprivation confounded with ------
- some --------------- suppress REM sleep, but learning/memory is not disrupted
- bilateral lesions of ---- abolish REM sleep, but patients led normal lives
- conclusion: REM sleep has no role in -------------

What about the effects of sleep overall?

- sleep deprivation reduces ------- memory by 38%
- sleep increases performance of procedural memories, like motor skill learning
- daytime ---- enhance declarative memories, maze learning, complex visual stimuli, paired words); performance correlated with the amount of NREM (non-REM) sleep

Conclusions:

- sleep has an important role in memory, attention, and executive function (Lowe et al., 2017)
- sleep actively promotes ==processing== of information learned during wakefulness
- sleep is important, not only for memory consolidation, but also for memory ==enhancement==

## Neurons, the Brain, and Memory

**Dual trace hypothesis** (Donald Hebb, 1949):
- memory formation (synaptic consolidation) requires two processes:
	1. short term: experience causes activity in certain neural ==circuits==
	2. longer term: continuous or repeated activity creates ------ change in nervous system
- “neurons that fire together, wire together”
- found in **Long term potentiation** (**LTP**): electrically induced changes in neural response (Hawkins & Kandel, 1984)
- kinds of neural change found to support learning:
- increased ==neurotransmitter== released
- increased ==size== of postsynaptic region
	- Receiving neuron turns on dormant receptor sites
- ==more== synapses formed

**Standard Model of Systems Consolidation** (Squire & Alvarez, 1995):

- initially, incoming information activates cortical areas (e.g., for vision, audition, etc.), and is integrated and coordinated by the hippocampus into a memory trace
- consolidation occurs via **==reactivation==**:
- hippocampus reactivates connections to the cortex associated with a memory
- occurs during sleep or by conscious rehearsal of a memory
- after repeated reactivation, long-lasting cortical interconnections are strengthened and/or new connections established
- new memories are integrated with existing ones
- activity in the hippocampus is no longer required

![Standard Model of Systems Consolidation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-16.jpg)

- predicts that retrograde amnesia (due to damaged hippocampus) should be temporally graded: memories formed closest in time to the traumatic event are most likely to be lost
	- This is shown with HM case study, and thus is accurate!

**Multiple Trace Theory of Consolidation** (Nadel & Moscovitch, 1997)

- proposes that semantic memories stored in the cortex gradually become ==independent== of the hippocampus (as in the Standard Model)

![Multiple Trace Theory of Consolidation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-17.jpg)

- in contrast, all episodic memories always involve the hippocampus, which provides spatial and temporal context (where and when)

![Multiple Trace Theory of Consolidation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s07-18.jpg)

- predicts that complete lesions of the hippocampus should impair all episodic memories--whether recent or remote
	- Shown also in KC case study.
