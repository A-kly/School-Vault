**Imagery**: mental representation of stimuli (objects, events) that are not physically present

What is the nature of the representation?

- analogical (“---------”)
- propositional (“-----------”)
- multiple coding

---

## Analog Coding

(Roger Shepard, Stephen Kosslyn)

Metaphor:

- imagery = perception
- images retain some sensory qualities; are pictorial

Processes:

- generation: images reconstructed from ==LTS== stores
- retention: images are maintained in ==STS==
- inspection: generated images can be ==scanned== by “mind’s eye”
- transformation: mental images can be manipulated like ==real== objects

Evidence:

Shepard & Metzler (1971): ==rotation==

- same/different task using pairs of “3-D” objects:

| ![3-D blocks](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-1.jpg) | <br><br>same (rotation in picture-plane)<br><br><br><br>same (rotation in depth)<br><br><br><br><br><br>same (rotation in depth) |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
- RT to decide “same” is a ==linear== function of angle of rotation:

![RT as a function of angle](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-2.png)

- RT for rotation in depth comparable to RT for rotation in picture-plane

Kosslyn (1975): ==size==

- imagine a ==rabbit== next to (a) a fly or (b) an elephant
- participants asked “Does a rabbit have ears?”
- RT 211 ms longer when target was beside ==larger== animal; participants reported that the size of “imagined” rabbit was smaller
- possible confounding produced by ==interest== level
- imagine target beside (a) ==giant== fly or (b) ==tiny== elephant
- longer RT when target beside larger animal

Kosslyn, Ball, & Reiser (1978): ==distance==

- participants memorized map:

![map of island](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-3.png)

- task: scan from one location to another, and press a button when destination reached
- results:

![RT as a function of distance](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-4.png)

- time to scan between imagined objects correlates with ==distance== between those objects on a map

Kosslyn (1973): distance

- participants shown drawing:

![image of boat](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-5.png)

- visualized it from memory, and focused on one ==end==
- was a named component in the drawing?
	- e.g., “motor” or “porthole” or “anchor”
- named object farther from place of focus -> ==longer== RTs
- lag time implied ==scan== of mental image

Roland & Friberg (1985): physiological evidence

- measured regional cerebral blood flow while participants:
- performed mental arithmetic
- thought of a musical jingle
- visually imaged a walk through their neighbourhood
- results: increased cerebral blood flow in visual cortex--only with ==imagery== task

---

## Propositional Coding

(Zenon Pylyshyn, 1973, 2006; Peter Slezak, 1995)

- uses metaphor of ==language==, not perception
- images are represented by abstract, symbolic, “descriptions” of visual scenes
- **==proposition==**: smallest piece of information that can be judged true or false
	- e.g., “The dog is brown.” has 1
	- “The small dog is brown.” has 2

- propositions formed by connections between nodes of a network:

![propositional representation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-6.png)

- mind represents concepts; may form images as an epiphenomenal ==by-product==
	- e.g., book represents information in words, which generate images when read

Evidence:

- certain operations possible for real images are not possible for mental images
	- e.g., ==mirrored== or negative images of faces (Phillips, 1972)
	- e.g., rotation of images (Slezak, 1991)

- *images are limited*

Nickerson & Adams (1979):

- showed 15 “pennies”, including an unmodified one
- most people (84%) could not identify the real penny
- images must be lacking in details
- experimenter expectancy, demand characteristics, and participants’ ==expectations== may be influencing results
- predictions of scanning time across island matched “mental scanning” (Mitchell & Richman, 1980)
- but this breaks down when predictions more difficult (scanning along a spiral vs. straight line)
- **==Whole-part== relationships**: finding particular shapes in a whole figure -> chance level (Reed, 1974)
- semantic (verbal) information may ==distort== recall of visual images

Carmichael, Hogan, & Walter (1932):

- name given to ambiguous figure affected remembering

---

## Multiple Codes

**Dual Coding Theory** (Allan Paivio, 1986; 2006)

- developed as a general theory of cognition

Storage: two independent but interacting systems:

- **==imagery== system**: stores images (“**==imagens==**”); right hemisphere processing
- **==verbal== system**: stores linguistic information or verbal descriptions (“**==logogens==**”); left hemisphere processing

Processing: in one or both systems:

- pictures: image processing; may also be labelled (verbal processing)
- concrete words: verbal processing; image may also be formed
- abstract words: verbal processing only

Connections:

- a concept is ==connected== to other related concepts in the same system (associative connections), and the other system (referential connections)
- activating any one concept also leads to activation of closely related concepts

Pros & cons:

- [p] Paivio & Csapo (1969): experimental support
	- stimuli: pictures, concrete words, and abstract words
	- varied rate of presentation:
	- fast = 5.3 items/s (limits participants to one code)
	- slow = 2 items/s (opportunity for ==dual== codes)
	- results on free recall task:

![recall as a function of presentation rate](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s10-7.png)

- two codes ==increase== likelihood of later retrieval
- imagen system superior to logogen system

- [p] Kounios & Holcomb (1994): EEG evidence
	- concrete words elicited greater activity than abstract words (dual coding)
	- concrete words activated both hemispheres equally (dual coding)
	- abstract words activated the left hemisphere more than the right (single code)

- [c] criticism: there is no need for two representational systems; all memories are stored one way (**==common coding== theory**)

Can using multiple coding ==interfere== with memory?

Schooler & Engstler-Schooler (1990):

- procedure: participants shown videotaped robbery (creates visual memory)
- task:
	- ==imagine== the robber
	- ==describe== the robber
	- do a series of math problems
	- then given recognition memory test (pick robber out of line-up of 8 people)
- results:

| **Task:** | **Recognition:** |
| --------- | ---------------- |
| imagine   | 55%              |
| describe  | 15%              |
| math      | 42%              |

- **verbal overshadowing effect**: verbalizing previously seen visual stimuli ==interferes== with the original visual memory

---

## Cognitive Maps

Have both metrical and structural components

- **metrical**: includes information about distances and directions; three types of knowledge:
	- **==landmark==**: information about particular features at a location
	- **==route-road==**: specific pathways for moving from one location to another
	- **==survey==**: estimated distances between landmarks
- **structural**: includes information about regions and clusters

Hirtle & Jonides (1985):

- distance between landmarks judged
- members of the same cluster judged to be closer than any member of another cluster
	- e.g., Is it farther to Chapters in St. Albert or 99 Ave./170 St.?

Milgram & Jodelet (1976):

- asked 215 Parisians to draw a map of the Seine river
- over 90% drew it ==Straighter== than it actually is
- cognitive maps do not always correspond to physical locations

Barbara Tversky (1981, 1993):

- when navigating space, people use ==heuristics:== methods that sometimes lead to a correct solution, but often oversimplify reality
	- e.g., Which is farther north, Rome or Philadelphia?

- **==density== heuristic**: greater number of landmarks on a route makes it seem longer
- **==symmetry== heuristic**: representing shapes as more symmetrical than they actually are
- **==right-angle== bias**: representing intersections as forming 90° angles more than the angles actually do
- **==rotation== heuristic**: representing slanted figures or boundaries as more vertical or horizontal then they actually are
- **==alignment== heuristic**: representing geographical features as more lined up with each other than they really are
- **==relative-position== heuristic**: representing relative positions of landmarks and boundaries by distorting cognitive maps to reflect conceptual knowledge, rather than actual spatial configurations

Why does our navigational fallibility persist?

Likely because we don’t often encounter ==feedback== about our geographical or travel-time inaccuracy.

## Wayfinding

Cornell, Sorenson, & Mio (2003):

- measured self-reports of “sense of direction” (SOD)
- also assessed wayfinding:
	- pointing to nonvisible ==landmarks==
	- ==revising== a route with a detour
	- devising a ==shortcut==
	- locate site within a building
	- found small-moderate correlations between these and ---
	- ------ for past performance -> SOD
- compared genders:
- males predominantly used **------ knowledge**: based on comparisons among landmarks; like bird’s eye view
- females relied on **----- knowledge**: based on a series of directions; like “vectors”
- females rated their SOD as ----- than males, but no gender differences obtained in ------ wayfinding
- problems may arise if typical ---- is given route knowledge, or if typical ------ is survey knowledge

---

## Eidetic Memory

- definition: detailed, vivid recollections of a complex visual scene; a.k.a. “------------ memory”

Haber & Haber (1964, 1988):

- tested elementary school age children, aged 7-12
- showed pictures on an easel for 30 s, then removed them and asked questions about them
- 8% of children performed significantly differently from the rest
- criteria for eidetic memory: images...
- must be reported
- must be positively coloured (not negative image)
- are projected onto space (not just “in the head”)
- described in the ------- tense
- associated with eye movements appropriate to the location of objects in the scene
- images lasted at least 40 s
- this ability is equally likely in males and females, but is less common in ------

Stromeyer & Psotka (1970):

- case study of eideteker named Elizabeth
- could reproduce a poem written in a foreign language that she did not understand, from bottom to top, as fast as she could write--even years later
- could fuse two-part random dot patterns, each containing --------- dots, presented 4 hours apart
- could also fuse two patterns presented a day apart into stereoscopic images
- however, no one else has passed such a test, Elizabeth refused to repeat any tests, and ended up -------- Stromeyer

Miller & Peacock (1982):

- compared eidetic 12-14 year old boys to control group

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**eidetic**|**control**|
|recall of picture details:|6.3|4.9|
|dot fusion (number correct out of 18)|13|3|

- eidetic more susceptible to ------------ from a second stimulus than controls
- eidetic memories lasted longer (25-180 s) than images of control group (0-13 s)

Conclusions:

- relatively rare ability to maintain vivid, detailed images; etiology unknown
- quantitatively and qualitatively --------- from non-eidetic memory
- not really “photographic memory”:
- recall far from -------
- memories ---- in a few minutes
- images easily disrupted by new visual stimulation

---

## Mnemonic Devices

- definition: techniques to aid memory, often by visually associating to-be-remembered items with a known series of images
- in an anecdotal story, the poet Simonides of Ceos (c. 500 BC) was said to have escaped a collapsing feast hall; he later identified the victims by imagining where they were sitting

Kinds of mnemonics:

- **method of ----**: associate to-be-recalled items with familiar locations (a “memory palace” or “Roman room”)
- **--- ---- system**: associate items with “pegs”

e.g., 1 is a bun, 2 is a shoe, 3 is a tree, etc.

- **--- ----**: connect sound of word with familiar word

e.g., -pato- (Spanish for “duck”) pronounced “pot-oh,” so picture a duck wearing a pot

- **------------**: hierarchically, or story, or rhyme

e.g., chunking

- **-------**: use first letter of each word to create pronounceable word

e.g. **POLKA** (=**P**egword, etc...)

- **--------**: use phrase made with first letters

e.g., **P**a **O**bserved **L**ice **K**issing **A**nts

Why do mnemonics work?

- provide structure for encoding and cues for retrieval
- apply multiple codes (verbal and imagery)
- form vivid, durable trace less subject to ------------
