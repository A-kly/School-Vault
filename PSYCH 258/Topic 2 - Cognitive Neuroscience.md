## Historical Origins

- The Case of Phineas Gage
	- 25-year-old railroad construction foreman for Rutland and Burland Railroad
	- in Vermont on September 13, 1848, an accident sent a tamping iron through his ==head==
	- regained consciousness shortly after; walked to nearest doctor
	- lost left eye, but was still able-bodied and intelligent; lived another 13 years
	- some reports claimed his ==behaviour== changed profoundly: disregarded social conventions, used profanity, lacked social responsibility
	- however, these reports are controversial, and may have been exaggerated
	- Ratiu & colleagues (2004):
		- created computer-generated 3-D reconstruction of Gage’s skull
		- concluded there was damage to left ------------- and prefrontal cortex
		- purported changes in Gage’s behaviour parallel those in patients with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala
		- considered to be “the index case for personality change due to frontal lobe damage” and “the historical beginnings of the study of the ---------- basis of behavior”

Alexander Luria (b.1902-d.1977)

- psychologist wrote about two now-famous case studies:
- a journalist with apparently unlimited ------ (-The mind of a mnemonist: A little book about a vast memory-, 1968)
- a man who whose brain injury abolished his ability to read, write, and speak (-The man with a shattered world: The history of a brain wound-, 1972)
- related brain areas to psychological functions
- created the field of ---------------

## What is Cognitive Neuroscience?

**Cognitive neuroscience**: investigates the neural mechanisms underlying all cognitive processes

- attempts to link mind to -----
- can all cognitive functions be ---------?
- how does this aid understanding?

**(Cognitive) neuropsychology**: also focuses on mental processes, but with an emphasis on studying the cognitive effects of brain injury or neurological illness, and applying the results to models of normal cognitive functioning

## Research Methods

- -------- observations:
- measure and record effects of brain damage/diseases
- relate damaged area to lost/disrupted function
- manipulation:
- **---------- stimulation of brain** (ESB): map effects to brain regions using electrodes (Penfield & Jasper, 1954)
- **-------**: surgical destruction of tissue

e.g., frontal lobotomy severs connection to frontal lobe; reduces seizures

- **TMS** (transcranial -------- stimulation):

**▸** magnetic coil placed beside head

**▸** pulse -------- neural activity; like temporary lesion

**▸** relates disrupted function to location

- record electrical activity:
- **--------------------** (EEG) measures **event-related potentials** (ERPs) produced by large numbers of neurons
- intra/extracellular recordings: measure activity of a single neuron, using microelectrode
- brain imaging:
- **PET** (-------- -------- tomography):

**▸** take radioactive form of glucose

**▸** X-rays cause positron to be emitted

**▸** shows metabolic activity

- **fMRI** (---------- magnetic resonance imaging):

**▸** hemoglobin (which carries oxygen in the blood) contains an iron atom that has magnetic properties

**▸** strong magnetic field (e.g., 3 Tesla) aligns magnetic molecules

**▸** radio wave pulse disorients them

**▸** upon realignment, protons emit radio waves which can be measured quickly

**▸** shows metabolic activity

- **----------- technique**:

**▸** brain imaging compares activity between two conditions

**▸** activity produced in control (or baseline) condition is subtracted from the activity produced in experimental condition

**▸** result shows the difference due to experimental manipulation

- pros & cons of brain imaging:

 can -correlate- active area with function

 can only ----------- active area with function

 applications range from promising (neurodiagnosis)...

 ...to dodgy (neuromarketing, neurolaw, even neuropolitics)

 naïve adults and neuroscience students were more likely (than experts) to be convinced by evidence containing (irrelevant) neuroscience ------: “Brain scans indicate...” (Weisberg et al., 2008)

## Localization of Function

Franz Josef Gall (b.1758-d.1828):

- discovered differences between grey matter (neuron cell bodies) and white matter (myelinated axons)
- “cranioscopy” came to be known as “----------”
- assumed that personality traits/abilities ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) -----, and brain ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) -----

### Language

- approx. 95% of population has language areas localized in left hemisphere
- **-------**: language difficulty due to brain damage
- **------**: loss of ability to name objects
- damage in left -------- lobe
- can be specific (e.g., cannot name colours, animals, or fingers)
- **------- aphasia** (Paul Broca, 1865):
- a.k.a. motor or expressive aphasia
- severely impaired ------; patient could only say “tan”
- problems forming sentences (spoken, written, and signed--but can draw and ----)
- comprehension relatively normal, but may be affected
- ----------- speech: nouns & verbs, but no function words
- caused by damage in left frontal lobe
- **---------- aphasia** (Carl Wernicke, 1874):
- a.k.a. sensory or receptive aphasia
- primarily a ------------- problem
- lack of awareness that speech is incomprehensible; comprehension impaired in nonverbal tasks (e.g., pointing)
- sentences may be fluent and grammatical, but gibberish: “---- -----”, neologisms
- caused by damage in left -------- lobe
- **---------- aphasia**:
- a.k.a. associative aphasia
- can comprehend language
- have fluent speech, but show paraphasic errors (e.g., dropping syllables)
- cannot ------ heard words; oral reading may also be poor
- caused by damage to arcuate fasciculus (connects Wernicke’s area to Broca’s area)
- **------- gyrus**:
- recodes visual information into auditory form
- damage causes breakdown in reading
- aphasias imply distinct processing units that work --------
- reading: visual cortex ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) angular gyrus ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) Wernicke’s

### Split-Brain Syndrome

- brain has many contralateral connections

e.g., object in right visual field ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) left occipital lobe (& vice-versa for object in left visual field)

e.g., left side of brain damaged ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Cognitive%20Neuroscience-files/right-new.png) loss of function on right side

- information shared across hemispheres via **------ --------**: about 200 million axons connecting the two cerebral hemispheres
- when corpus callosum is surgically severed to treat extreme epilepsy, the result is **split-brain syndrome**: two ----------- brain hemispheres
- studied by Roger Sperry (awarded 1981 Nobel Prize)
- left hemisphere: generally specialized for ------ and analysis
- right hemisphere: generally better at --------- tasks: idenfying faces, handling emotions, perceptual/spatial tasks

## Changes in the Brain

### Neurogenesis

- definition: creation of new neurons in an adult brain from adult ---- cells (neurons themselves do not reproduce)
- through much of the 20th century, neurogenesis was believed -not- to exist
- was observed in brains of adult animals in the 1960s
- evidence in adult humans found, starting in late 1990s
- these new neurons have been implicated in memory formation

e.g., new hippocampal neurons exhibit long-term changes in response to experience during the first two weeks of “life” (Ge et al., 2007)

### Neuroplasticity

- definition: modifications to structure and function of neural -------- due to changes in neurons and their connections
- generally accepted to occur in childhood:
- neurons and connections initially proliferate (until about 8 months), probably forming ------ connections
- this is followed by **-------**: synapses are eliminated (due to lack of use?)
- the number of synapses in an adult brain is about 40% less than the peak in childhood

e.g., evidence suggests pruning is complete in the visual cortex by age 10, but continues in the frontal cortex until adolescence

- experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex:
- with normal input, the visual cortex will develop to process visual information from the eyes
- animals deprived of visual experience will be functionally -----
- animals selectively exposed to certain visual stimuli (e.g., vertical lines only) will develop vision sensitive to vertical lines (and insensitive to horizontal lines)
- these effects obtain in response to visual deprivation during a **-------- period**: time during which particular visual experience is required to develop normal vision
- neuroplasticity was initially believed to occur only in young brains; however, evidence has accumulated to show that connections can continue to change in adult brains throughout the lifespan
- visual cortex of blind people can change to respond to sound or other sensory input
- body maps in the somatosensory cortex of adult monkeys changed to respond to adjacent fingers when one digit was amputated
- (these changes may be due to brain remapping, or to an enhancement of existing pathways)
- fMRI studies have demonstrated changes in patterns of brain activity in response to learning, skill acquisition, and environmental stimulation in adults (e.g., learning new motor skills, acquiring new languages, or mastering musical instruments)
- possible mechanisms for plasticity in adulthood:
- by changing the -------- of the existing connections: the more frequently a connection is used, the stronger it becomes (and vice-versa)
- **--------------**: the formation of new synapses throughout the lifespan; may be more specific and selective, guided by experience

Clinical/commercial ------------ of plasticity:

- overcoming balance disorders (BrainPort®)
- restoring vision (NovaVision®)
- ADHD therapy (Cogmed Working Memory Training™, EndeavorRx®)
- treating learning disorders (Arrowsmith Program®, Fast ForWord®)
- “brain --------” programs
- sales of brain training programs worth US$5.2 billion in 2023; projected to exceed US$40 billion by 2030 (Verified Market Research, 2024)

e.g., Nintendo DS™ game Brain Age™ inspired by the work of neuroscientist Ryuta Kawashima (2005) at Tohoku University in Japan

e.g., others include Lumos Labs’ Lumosity®, CogniFit®, and Posit Science’s BrainHQ

### Brain Training

Can neuroplasticity be harnessed to reverse the effects of age-related cognitive decline?

- exercise (Kramer et al., 1999):
- participants: “couch potatoes,” aged 60-75
- experimental group did light aerobic exercise (e.g., walking)
- control group did non-aerobic exercise (e.g., stretching)
- after 6 months, experimental group showed fewer age-related deficits on some attentional and memory functions
- follow-up study found that exercise (walking 40 minutes/day, 3 days/week) increased hippocampal volume--correlated with improved memory test scores (Erickson et al., 2011)
- underlying mechanism of exercise is the release of **------------ factors** that promote neuronal survival and growth

e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) increases formation of blood vessels, neurogenesis, and gray matter volume in brain regions responsible for executive function (Fakhoury et al., 2022)

- strategy videogames (Basak et al., 2008):
- used -Rise of Nations- ®-: Gold Edition-,a real-time strategy game in which players manipulate troops and structures to capture territory and destroy opponents’ assets
- healthy elderly participants played “Quick Battle” games
- played 24 hours over 5 weeks; were cognitively tested before, during, and after training
- players -------- in game performance
- compared to controls, there was no change in word recall, enumeration (quickly counting dots), or functional field of view
- however, players improved in --------- control functions: task switching, working memory, visual short-term memory, and reasoning
- action video games (Green & Bavelier, 2003; 2007; 2018):
- non-gamers played first-person-shooter games, like -Unreal Tournament 2004- ™, and -Medal of Honor: Allied Assault- ™
- resulted in enhanced visual attention, spatial cognition, and visual ----------
- meta-analysis found a one-third of a standard deviation improvement
- ACTIVE (Advanced Cognitive Training for Independent and Vital Elderly) (Ball et al., 2002):
- nationwide clinical trial of 2,832 ------- elderly participants
- experimental groups given regular practice in one of three modalities: reasoning, memory, and speed of processing
- used Posit Science’s computer-based Brain Fitness Program (now called BrainHQ) based on brain plasticity; developed by neuroscientist Michael Merzenich
- had 10 sessions of group training
- results:

**▸** reasoning: 87% of participants improved

**▸** memory: 26% improved

**▸** speed of processing: 74% improved

**▸** results stable over 24 months

**▸** however, no generalization/transfer obtained; no improvement in non-trained modalities; gains vs. controls were small

- periodic ------- training resulted in reasoning-trained group showing better performance on daily activities after 5 years (Willis et al., 2006)
- 10-year follow-up: most reasoning- and speed-trained participants experienced less decline than controls (Rebok et al., 2014)
- also 29% reduced risk of -------- (Edwards et al., 2017)

Potential problem: Are positive results due to -------- effects, or to lasting improvements in underlying cognitive function that generalize (transfer to other tasks)?

- Simons et al. (2016):
- comprehensive review of 132 studies
- many studies had ------ problems (e.g., small sample size, inadequate control groups)
- generally, performance improved on training tasks
- however, there is little evidence of -------- from training tasks to general cognitive ability
- Shah et al. (2017):
- systematic review of almost 8,000 studies
- excluded studies using video games, of patients with dementia, or of cognitively healthy older adults
- only two brain-training programs had multiple peer-reviewed supporting studies (BrainHQ and CogniFit)
- both showed some generalization

Conclusions:

- adult brains exhibit ----------
- ---------- may change the brain via neurogenesis or neuroplasticity
- initial work suggested that the brain was undergoing wholesale rewiring
- however, recent research has shown that the brain refines its existing abilities through intensive training and learning (Makin & Krakauer, 2023)
- many factors may contribute, including:
- type of training
- age of participant
- level of cognitive/physical health
- number of sessions
- length of sessions
- duration of training period
- performance on training task may improve, but there is little evidence of --------------
