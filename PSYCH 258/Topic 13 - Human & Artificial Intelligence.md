## What is Intelligence?

- “==common sense==”?
- “==intelligence== as a measurable capacity must at the start be defined as the capacity to do well in an intelligence test. Intelligence is what the tests test” (Boring, 1923, p.35)
- an inferred trait, representing the abilities to learn from experience, acquire knowledge, think abstractlly, and adapt to changes

## The First Tests

Francis Galton (1822-1911):

- ran a service at South Kensington Museum in London
- would check your intelligence for a fee
- tests mostly ==perceptual==
- pros & cons:

- [p] pioneer in the study of intelligence

- [p] contributed much to statistics

- [c] concluded success was due to ==heredity==

- [c] started the ==eugenics== movement: improving humanity’s physical and mental composition by selective parenthood

Alfred Binet & Theodore Simon (1905/1916):

- developed a test to identify ==slow== learners
- found they performed at the level of younger children
- compared ==mental== age (MA) with chronological age (CA)
- components:
	- **==vocabulary==** e.g., “What does -*misanthrope*- mean?”
	- **==comprehension==** e.g., “Why do people sometimes borrow money?”
	- **==verbal== relations** e.g., “What do an orange, an apple, and a pear have in common?”
- assumptions:
	- test shows current performance differences
- purpose: identify children who need special ==help==
	- believed special training could help slow learners catch up
	- test not based on a theoretical conception of “==intelligence==”

Lewis Terman (1916):

- modified test for use in US (Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales)
- based on Stern’s (1912) **intelligence ==quotient==**:
	- IQ = (MA / CA) × 100
	- test fine-tuned to make mean score = 100, standard deviation = 15
- pros & cons:
	- [p] easy to administer and score
	- [c] hard to ==compare== children of different chronological ages
	- [c] could not be applied to ==adults==
	- [c] test was largely language-based

David Wechsler (1939):
- developed tests:
	- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS)
	- Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)
	- Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI)
	- provide verbal, performance, and overall scores, plus IQ-equivalents
	- included more ==nonverbal== questions

## Issues

- **Validity**

James McKeen Cattell (1890):

- devised tests based on Galton’s work
- assessed by his student, Clark Wissler
- virtually no ==correlation== between intelligence and college grades
	- (conventional IQ tests: correlations of .40 to .60)
- tests used extensively during WWI
- Army Alpha: verbal test
	- People can't read, so this didn't work well
- Army Beta: performance test, with ==pantomimed== directions instead of words
- used to determine job classification and leadership potential (or, who got sent to the front lines)
- intelligence came to be seen as inherited ==trait==, not index of learning performance
- tests ==culturally== biased:
	- e.g., “I don’t sing for nobody” Single- or double-negative?
	- e.g., Dove Counterbalance General Intelligence Test (1971), a.k.a. the Chitling Test
- Is one culture less intelligent, or is the test ==flawed==?
- Some cultures don’t believe in testing or competitive ==ranking== - should they be exempt?
- Do results reveal a lack of ==ability== important in our society?
- Is the ==reason== for a low score important?
- most intelligence tests are ==psychometric:== depend on the number of correct answers
- possible solution: use other kinds of ==tests==, as well
- check for physiological or psychological problems
- diagnose specific learning disability
- **==Flynn== effect** (James R. Flynn, 1987; 2000; 2007):
	- unstandardized intelligence scores have been increasing over time
	-  14-point gain from 1932 to 1978
	-  annual gain from 1947-1972 was 0.31 points (0.36 in the 1990s)
	-  greatest increases seen in lower grades, but not for children in grade 12 (limit?)
	-  not all subtests increase equally, thus intelligence is not a ------ entity
	- the nature of intelligence has changed from practical to conceptual, due to social change
		- e.g., What do dogs and rabbits have in ------?
	- increases in IQ are not be due to changes in genetics--they must be -------------
	-  influence of television, schooling, parenting, etc.
	-  kids watching basketball games on TV could learn new moves and improve their performance to match star players; their improved performance would challenge and enrich the playing of other kids on the court
	-  jobs increasingly required more logical reasoning and analysis, so schooling focused more on logical reasoning and analysis and more people complete high school, leading to generational changes in abstract reasoning
	- this is called the **social multiplier effect**: a virtuous cycle of skill improvement

## Other Intelligences

Charles Spearman (1927):

- is intelligence monolithic, or comprised of different factors?
- **factor analysis**: determines minimum number of dimensions necessary to explain a pattern of correlations among subtests
- correlated scores on verbal, quantitative, analytical subtests
- some evidence for a general “-g- ” factor of intelligence
- correlations are not perfect; there are specific factors affecting each subtest
- pros & cons:
	- [p] more ------- tasks (e.g., academic achievement, job performance) highly correlated with -g-
	- [c] other theorists have proposed other intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other

**Theory of Multiple Intelligences** (Howard Gardner, 2008, 2011b):

- -------- for intelligence:
- isolated by brain damage
- existence of prodigies, savants
- identifiable core operations (e.g., music: melody, harmony, rhythm, etc.)
- distinctive developmental history
- evolutionary plausibility
- support from experimental psychology
- psychometric support
- encodable in a symbol system
- multiple intelligences:
- **----------**: poets, writers, linguists
- **--------mathematical**: mathematicians, scientists, philosophers
- **-------**: composers, conductors, musicians
- **spatial**: architects, artists, navigators
- **-------kinesthetic**: dancers, athletes, actors
- **-------------** (understanding others) and **intrapersonal** (understanding oneself): psychiatrists, politicians, anthropologists
- **naturalist**: biologists, naturalists
- (maybe also existential: spiritual leaders?)
- how should these be used?
- descriptive, not ------------
- not in standardized test, but in real life or simulations
- for more effective -------- and assessment

(but there is virtually no evidence that matching type of instruction to “learning style” optimizes learning (Pashler et al., 2008))

- criticisms:

- [c] lacks empirical --------; rather, many of Gardner’s intelligences correlate with -g-

- [c] there is no test of multiple intelligences; assessment relies on subjective judgment

- [c] “intelligences” are more like “---------” or “aptitudes” (what’s the difference?)

**Triarchic Theory of Successful Intelligence** (Robert Sternberg, 1985):

1. **------------** (analytical) **intelligence**

a) **--------------**: recognizing a problem, selecting a procedure to solve it, checking the results

b) **performance components**: planning, implementing the procedure

c) **----------acquisition components**: learning how to solve a problem

2. **------------** (creative) **intelligence**

- applying your knowledge on a specific task (automated or novel tasks)
- may require creativity/divergent thinking

3. **----------** (practical) **intelligence**

- ability to a) adapt to, b) shape, or c) select one’s environment
- measured by STAT (Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test)
- intelligence is more a matter of using what you’ve got, not how much you’ve got
- criticisms:

- [c] traditional intelligence tests correlate with income, occupational prestige, and ability to stay out of jail, which are supposedly measures of practical intelligence

## Other Factors

Terman & colleagues: “Genetic Studies of Genius” (1925-1959)

- how to bridge gap between potential and achievement?
- 1,528 gifted children with IQ greater than 135 (top 1%) were followed starting in 1921
- compared most vs. least successful (school/work/ambition)
- no -- difference, but difference in ----------

Duckworth & Seligman (2005):

- self-discipline in 8th-graders measured by self-report, parent report, teacher report, and monetary choice questionnaire
- self-discipline predicted final grades, attendance, standardized achievement test scores, selection into competitive high school program
- self-discipline was more important than IQ in contributing to final grades

## Artificial Intelligence (AI): Beginnings

John von Neumann (1945):

- conceived of stored -------- program for controlling operations of computer hardware (vs. physical switches)
- headed team to develop machine to calculate artillery trajectories for Ballistics Research Laboratory

J. Presper Eckert & John W. Mauchly (1946):

- built **-----**: Electronic Numerical Integrator And Calculator in 1946
- first electronic large-scale general-purpose digital computer
- first to handle ---------- and numeric data

Alan Turing (1950):

- asked, “Can machines -----?”
- developed “the imitation game,” a.k.a. the **Turing test**:
- judge sits in a room, with an ------ in another room
- communicates with entity via keyboard
- is the entity human or not?
- not proposed as a test of ------------

Newell & Simon (1956):

- created Logic Theorist program
- designed to solve mathematical proofs, play games
- later created General Problem Solver

“**Artificial intelligence**”coined by John McCarthy in 1956

- programs were not “------”, but didn’t have to be

e.g., flying: birds vs. ornithopters vs. airplanes

Computer Vision

- Marvin Minsky, Terry Winograd attempted robotic vision
- used simplified version of the world: “----- world”
- robots programmed to “see” and move blocks
- not very ----------

e.g., tried to build tower from top down

AI & Language

- Weizenbaum (1966) wrote ELIZA, a virtual Rogerian therapist
- was merely a “bag of ------”
- Chamberlain & Etter (1984) created RACTER (short for “raconteur”)
- BASIC program, running on Z80 chip with 64K RAM
- RACTER “wrote” -The Policeman’s Beard is Half Constructed-, a collection of ------ and prose
- these are mere “-----------”, with primitive knowledge bases; understanding language is hard

Machine Translation

- could work word-by-word (sort of)
- plagued by problems due to inherent --------- of language

e.g., “Mary saw the bicycle in the store window, and she wanted it.”

vs. “Mary saw the bicycle in the store window; she looked at it longingly and pressed her nose up against it.”

- a sentence in a technical journal had 1+ ------- syntactically correct interpretations

## Criticisms

Moravec’s paradox (1988):

- for computers, “hard things are easy, and easy things are hard”
- things most people find difficult can easily be done by computers (e.g., playing chess or doing calculus)
- however, abilities that humans find easy or even trivial are very difficult for computers to do (e.g., object perception, understanding context in conversations)

Dreyfus (1972):

- wrote -What computers can’t do: A critique of artificial reason-
- problems due to fundamental ----------- between humans and computers:
- consciousness
- body to unitize sensory experience
- fatigue, boredom, drive
- intentionality (sense of -------)

Lighthill (1972):

- 20 years of research into AI had been a great --------------

Result: “AI ------” of decreased funding and research.

---

## Classical AI: Expert Systems

- everyday, generalized intelligence is hugely complex
- instead, concentrate on intelligence displayed by experts in a ------ domain
- expert system consists of **--------- base** developed by **knowledge engineer**
- uses **inference ------** to apply rules to facts, to solve a problem
- number of expert systems has increased to tens of thousands; $1+ billion industry
- most popular: finance, manufacturing control, fault diagnosis

Shortliffe & colleagues (1973): MYCIN

- asks questions like, “Has the patient recently suffered burns?” or “Does the patient have a known allergy to Colistin?”
- knowledge of bacterial infections represented as ~450 -----
- performed as well as ------- (better than med students and residents) at Stanford Medical School (Yu et al., 1979)

Pros & Cons:

- [p] highly specialized and accurate

- [c] difficult to --------- knowledge of experts

- [c] no intuition; could not ----- from mistakes

- [c] limited to domain of expertise (“weak” or “narrow” AI)

## AI & Common Sense

- scripts (Schank & Abelson, 1977) and frames (Minsky, 1975) developed to aid machine translation
- explicitly represented background knowledge
- give a frame of reference

Lenat (1984, 2017): Cyc (short for “------------”)

- explicitly represents knowledge -not- found in an encyclopedia
- “common sense knowledge base” of over 24 million hand-entered rules; divided into “-------------”

e.g., “On January 2, Abraham Lincoln was in Washington” implies that:

- Lincoln’s left --- was probably in Washington, too
- his parents remained his parents for life
- he was in Washington for the whole day
- pros & cons:

- [p] successful applications include Terrorism Knowledge Base, natural-language database of medical information, and financial analysis

- [c] still a work in progress (cannot separate fact from fiction; hand-entering knowledge is slow and tedious; expensive to develop)

---

## Artificial Neural Networks

all of the above are GOFAI (“Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence”), or classical symbolic AI based on human-coded programming

- the problem with AI is that it doesn’t have a -----
- solution: give it a brain!
- artificial neural networks (ANNs) are inspired by the function of neurons
- a.k.a. PDP approach, or **connectionism**: emergent properties that arise from interconnected networks of processing units
- instead of being programmed with explicit rules, ANNs apply **------- --------**: letting computers develop algorithms iteratively from data

Perceptron:

- early attempt at ANN by Frank Rosenblatt (1958)
- had array of 400 photocells in a one-layer neural network that could classify images into one of two categories
- connections could be modified, but network was simple and computationally -------

New Connectionism:

- algorithms were developed to allow ANNs to self-modify connections in multilayer networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986)
- result: ANNs with more sophisticated neurons used feedback to ------ connection weights (**supervised learning**)
- were able to ----- from experience
- had greater computational power; could solve more complex problems
- however, the computational limitations of this approach eventually became apparent leading to a second AI winter in the 1990s

Deep Learning:

- new approach to ANNs inspired by the structure and organization of the -------- ------, starting in the mid-2000s leading to an “AI spring” (e.g., Krizhevsky et al., 2012: AlexNet)
- contributing factors:
- access to huge, labeled datasets
- availability of enormous computing power in graphics-processing units (GPUs) originally designed for video games
- multiple ------ of neurons, allowing representation of more abstract concepts

e.g., pixels ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Human%20&%20Artificial%20Intelligence-files/right-new.png) edges ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Human%20&%20Artificial%20Intelligence-files/right-new.png) features ![→](PSYCH%20258-%20Human%20&%20Artificial%20Intelligence-files/right-new.png) faces

- examples:
- Google Brain (Le at al., 2012):

-  has 16,000 processors with 1 billion connections

-  watched 10 million YouTube videos and by itself was able to identify what a --- was despite being fed no information on distinguishing features that might help identify it

- Microsoft’s Project Adam (Chilimbi et al., 2014):

-  has 2 billion connections, requires 30× fewer processors, but is claimed to be twice as accurate as competitors

-  processed ImageNet database, which has 14 million images organized into 22,000 categories

-  result: can identify dogs in images, even whether a ----- is a Pembroke or a Cardigan

Real-World Applications:

- Autonomous vehicle (e.g., Waymo Driver)
- navigates using data from GPS, camera, LIDAR (laser imaging, detection, and ranging), and multiple radar sensors
- ANN also “------” by human driver
- has driven over 32 million km by itself
- autonomous technologies increasingly available in consumer vehicles (e.g., automatic parking, collision avoidance systems, autonomous cruise control, etc.)
- limitations:

- [c] cannot drive on an area not yet ------

- [c] cannot detect lane markings in wet/snowy conditions

- Large language model chatbots: OpenAI’s ChatGPT
- ANN based on statistical relationships of words in its training data
- GPT = generative pre-trained transformer

-  generative: can simulate conversations, create computer code, and write prose and poetry

-  pre-trained: trained on a corpus of text containing 300 billion words taken from web pages, programming language documentation, books, YouTube videos, and other sources

-  transformer: deep-learning architecture that processes sequential data (like words in a sentence)

- GPT-4o estimated to have 1.76 trillion “----------” or variables; these include weights of connections between ANN neurons
- limitations:

- [c] often gives plausible but --------- answers

- [c] subject to algorithmic bias present in the training data, including gender and racial biases

## The Future of AI

**AI Calibre** (Urban, 2015)

- **AI Calibre 1: Artificial ------ Intelligence**
- may be equal to or superior to human intelligence in a very narrow domain
- but is the same as humans only at level 1, computational theory, in Marr’s tri-level hypothesis

e.g., IBM’s Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Kasparov in 1997

- **AI Calibre 2: Artificial ------- Intelligence**
- can perform the same tasks a human can
- is the same as humans at level 1, and at level 2, representation and algorithm as well

e.g., N/A

- **AI Calibre 3: Artificial -----------------**
- “any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest” (Bostrom, 2014, p.22)
- likely will be the same as humans only at the level of computational theory

e.g., N/A

### AI & Consciousness

John Searle (1980): The ------- ---- argument

- imagine you are alone in a room

1. slip of paper with Chinese symbols enters room
2. you look up symbol in book
3. you write down more symbols on paper
4. you send slip out

- you do not understand Chinese
- so where is the ------------- of Chinese?
- computers just manipulate symbols; they will never have a “mind” or “consciousness” which is an emergent property
- based on two ideas:
- brains cause -----
- ------ does not suffice for semantics

Ray Kurzweil (1999): -The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence-

- computers are doubling in power about every 2 years
- predicted they should have computational capacity comparable to human brain by ----
- defines consciousness as:
- the ability to have subjective experience
- the ability of a being, animal or entity to have self-perception and self----------
- the ability to feel
- predicted a computer will declare, “I think, therefore I am.” before ----
- in 2005, predicted a “technological -----------,” when artificial superintelligence emerges, in 2045

“The question of whether machines can think...is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim.” -- Edsger W. Dijkstra, 1984

**Human-Centred AI** (Shneiderman, 2022)

- emerging discipline developing AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, and capabilities
- AI should enhance human abilities and well-being, not replace or diminish human roles
- is interdisciplinary, involving psychologists, ---------, and AI experts
- goal is to create AI that is fair, respects privacy, and delivers equitable outcomes

e.g., personalized healthcare assistant AI

- supports patients by giving customized health advice, medication reminders, and scheduling appointments
- interacts with users in a conversational manner, making it more accessible and user-friendly
