## Problems

- **==well==-defined**: initial state, goal state, and permissible operations completely specified
	- e.g., (3x-2)(2x+5)=(3x-2)(x+4), solve for x

- **==ill==-defined**: uncertainty in one or more components
	- e.g., write a ==novel==

Forms of problems (Greeno, 1978):

- **Problems of Inducing ==Structure==**: determine relationship among several given elements
	- e.g., analogy problems (Miller Analogies Test)

- four steps required to solve:
	1. encoding: identify appropriate attributes
	2. ==inference:== relate 1st and 2nd elements
	3. ==mapping:== relate 1st and 3rd elements
	4. application: relate 3rd and 4th elements

- **Problems of ==transformation==**: find sequence of operations to transform initial state into goal state
	- e.g., Tower of Hanoi (Édouard Lucas, 1883)

- skill required: means-end analysis?
- **Problems of Arrangement**: arrange elements according to a criterion
	- e.g., ==anagrams:== arrange the letters AIFMA to make a word

- skills required:
	-  generate possibilities/reject impossibles
	-  constrain search
	-  retrieve solution patterns

Three requirements for understanding a problem (Greeno, 1991):

1. ==coherence:== representation comprised of parts connected in a way that makes sense
2. ==correspondence:== internal representation “maps well” onto elements of the problem
3. relationship to ==background== knowledge: problem elements linked to existing knowledge

---

## Problem Solving

- **==algorithm==**: set of operations that systematically and exhaustively generates a solution
	- e.g., What’s the mean of 3, 4, 2, 5, 3, and 7?

- **==heuristic==**: strategy that often helps generate a solution; do not guarantee success
	- e.g., When do you take another card in blackjack?

Newell & Simon (1972): -Human Problem Solving-

- **==problem space==**: collection of nodes, each representing a state of knowledge or possible action
- problem solving seen as search through problem space
- states:
	- initial
	- intermediate
	- goal

![Tower of Hanoi](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s12-01.png)

- **==operators==**: links between nodes; consist of functions selected to solve problems
- there may be path constraints ruling out some possibilities

**General Problem Solver** (Newell, Shaw, & Simon, 1959):

- computer program intended to simulate human problem solving
- applied **==means-end== analysis**:
	- transform: compare current state and goal state; note any differences
	- reduce: find operator that most reduces the difference
	- apply: apply operator to current state
- subgoals create intermediate states that are closer to the goal state
- pros & cons:

- [p] successfully applied to Tower of Hanoi, logic proofs
- [c] requires ==well-defined== goals/problem spaces to function
- [c] poor simulation of human problem solving:

- people inadvertently move backward, make illegal moves
	- e.g., Hobbits & Orcs Problem

- does not draw on stored ==knowledge==
- short-term memory limits the number of subgoals (3 steps?)

---

## Analogies

- solving a problem by using a solution to a related problem
- requires:
	- seeing similarity in basic structure of the problems
	- inferring appropriate solution for current problem from analogous problem

Duncker (1945): the radiation problem

- patient has inoperable stomach tumour
- can be destroyed by high ==radiation==
- will also destroy any healthy tissue it passes through
- low radiation is ineffective
- what to do?

Gick & Holyoak (1980):

- control group: given radiation problem
- analogy group: also given analogous fortress problem:
	- goal: use army to capture fortress
	- resources: sufficiently large army
	- constraint: unable to move army along road all at once, due to mines triggered by large numbers of troops
	- operators: divide army; move army; attack using army
- solution: send ==small== groups along ==multiple== roads ==simultaneously==
- analogy + hint group: also given hint that second problem would help with the first
- results:

| **Group:**     | **Solved:** |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| control        | 8%          |
| analogy        | 30%         |
| analogy + hint | 92%         |

- people can infer solutions from analogies--if they realize the analogy is appropriate (difficult to do)
- also important: time between 1st and 2nd problems:

| **Delay:** | **Solved:** |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| none       | 10%         |
| short      | 32%         |
| long       | 12%         |

- abstraction: participants given ==multiple== similar analogies were more likely to use analogy

---

## Other Factors

**Mindlessness**: thoughtless application of old ways of thinking to new situations without completely considering whether they are suitable

- **entrapment by ==categories==**: thinking of objects only in terms of the categories they fit into
- **==automatic== behaviour**: doing things without thinking about them
- **acting from a single ==perspective==**: thinking of only one way to accomplish a goal

Ellen Langer (1989; Langer & Piper, 1987):

- participants shown three unfamiliar objects: dog’s rubber chew toy, polygraph pen, hair dryer attachment
- half the participants given unconditional description:
	- e.g., “This is a dog’s chew toy.”

- other half given ==conditional== description:
	- e.g., “This could be a dog’s chew toy.”

- experimenter pretended to need an eraser; asked participants for help
- results:
	- 40% of participants in conditional group gave a ==mindful== response (use chew toy as eraser)
	- 0% of other group did

**Mental Set** (Gestaltists: -Einstellung- or “attitude”): predisposition to solve a problem in a certain way

Luchins (1942): water jars problem

| **Jar A** | **Jar B** | **Jar C** | **Want** | **Answer**    |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 29        | 3         | -         | 20       | A-3B          |
| 21        | 127       | 3         | 100      | B-A-2c        |
| 20        | 59        | 4         | 31       | B-A-2c        |
| 23        | 49        | 3         | 20       | B-A-2c OR A-C |

**Functional Fixedness**: inability to use objects for other than their most common purpose

Duncker (1945): candle problem

- participants were given candle, book of matches, box of tacks
- task: affix candle to the wall
- solution: ==tack box== to wall, use as candle holder

Causes of mindlessness:

- repetition of an action: becomes automatic
- premature cognitive commitments: maintaining a point of view even if it’s sub-optimal
- education: instruction in only one way of doing things, focus on outcome rather than learning itself

**Past Experience**: may help or hinder problem solving

Feather (1966):

- women asked to solve 15 anagram puzzles
- were given either easy or ==impossible== anagrams
- estimated their chances before attempting each one
- last puzzle was moderate difficulty
- results:

| **Puzzle group:** | **Estimate of success:** | **Success on last puzzle:** |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| easy              | increased                | good                        |
| impossible        | decreased                | poor                        |

- success may be a self-fulfilling prophesy

**Incubation**: problem solving facilitated by time away from it

Smith & Blankenship (1989):

- participants were given rebus puzzles and clues; some clues were misleading

-  control gp: given 60 s per puzzle

-  incubation gp: 30 s / interruption / 30 s

- prediction: incubation gp should -*benefit*- from interruption
- incubation gp performed ==better==; were also less likely to remember clues
- but: incubation effects not consistently found
- if found, may be due to:
	-  release ==(forgetting)== from mental set/functional fixedness
	-  retrieval of new information by changing context
	-  recovery from fatigue
	-  conscious problem solving in the interim
	-  ==unconscious== processes

---

## Insight

- definition: a kind of problem solving characterized by:
- suddenness/surprisingness
- ease
- positive ==affect==
- feeling of being correct/confidence
- the entire solution enters awareness at once (as opposed to a stepwise solution); a.k.a. the “-*Aha*!- ” moment

Wolfgang Köhler (1927): -*The Mentality of Apes*-

- stranded in Tenerife, Canary Islands during World War I
- observed Sultan, a caged chimpanzee in a scientific station
- Sultan used bamboo sticks as tools to reach ==bananas== just outside of his cage
- also moved box underneath banana suspended from ceiling
- Rana, even after observing Sultan, was unable to do this
- Köhler’s book influenced writing of -*2001: A Space Odyssey*-, and -*Planet of the Apes*-

Gestalt View:

- insight problems require perception of the problem as a whole
- **==reproductive== thinking**: based on existing associations involving what is already known
- **==productive== thinking**: insights that go beyond the bounds of existing associations
- causes of insight:
	- extended (unconscious) leaps in thinking
	- accelerated mental processing
	- short-circuiting of ==normal== reasoning processes
- but: no evidence for this; poor definition of insight

Nothing-Special View:

- “insight” does not exist
- “insight” problems solved ==*without*== sudden mental restructuring
- and routine problems solved -*with*- sudden mental restructuring

Neo-Gestaltist View (Janet Metcalfe, 1986):

- insightful problem solving distinguished by:
	- low ==accuracy== in predicting success on insight problems; high accuracy for routine problems
	- for insight problems, successful problem solvers were pessimistic about their ability; unsuccessful people were optimistic
	- participants rated closeness to solution on 10-point scale (“cold” to “warm” to “hot”) at 15 s intervals
- routine problems: warmth increased gradually
- insight problems: mostly ==cold== - then problem solved

Three-Process View (Davidson & Sternberg, 1984):
- there are three kinds of insight, involving three different processes
	1. **selective-==encoding== insights**: involve distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information
		- e.g., taking notes during a lecture: what’s important?
	2. **selective-==comparison== insights**: involve novel perception of how new information relates to old
		- e.g., creative use of analogies; learning new definitions
	3. **selective-==combination== insights**: involve combining selectively encoded and compared information in a novel way
		- e.g., writing a term paper; solving the candle problem

Schooler, Ohlsson & Brooks (1993):

- task: a series of insight and logic problems
- gp1: required to ==verbalize== strategies while solving problem
- gp2: did not
- results (**% Correct**):

|           | **Type of Problem** | **Type of Problem** |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Group** | **Insight**         | **Logic**           |
| verbal    | 55                  | 63                  |
| control   | 80                  | 67                  |

- **verbal overshadowing effect**: “==verbal== system” processing interferes with insight problem solving ability
---

## Expertise

### Encoding

Norman, Brooks, & Allen (1989):

- compared medical ==specialists== & med students
- task 1: interpret/diagnose patient data; recall as much as possible (==incidental== memory)
- task 2: given patient data, try to remember as much as possible (==intentional== memory)
- experts over twice as good on task 1; no difference on task 2
- experts have domain-specific schemas that aid remembering

### Representation

Eylon & Reif (1984):

- developed two versions of a physics chapter
- one had traditional historical organization; other was hierarchical, based on physics principles and developed by experts
- high-school students using hierarchical text had:
	- 40% improvement in retention
	- 25% better scores in problem solving
- better structure and ==representation== resulted in better performance
- interrelationships of knowledge is important
	- e.g., specific categories subsumed under more general ones

- ==hierarchical== organization:

![hierarchical representation](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s12-02.png)

(dotted lines represent mental ==shortcuts==)

- experts are better able to extract underlying structure from problems and sort them into categories
- novices are poorer at differentiation (representation is ==flatter==), and tend to sort problems by surface details

### Problem Solving

- **==proceduralization==**: converting declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge
Sweller, Mawer, & Ward (1983):

- studied novices solving kinematics problems
- explicitly wrote formula first: -*v*- = -*at*-
- eventually just wrote the ==values:== -*v*- = 2 × 10 (formula implicit)


- **==tactical== learning**: specific rules learned for specific problems
Greeno (1974):

- four repetitions needed to solve Hobbits & Orcs perfectly
- experts don’t solve problems all over from ==scratch==

- **==strategic== learning**: problem solving organized in an optimal way for problems in that domain
Anderson (1983):

- studied computer programmers
- experts developed solutions ==bredth== first: worked out sub-problems recursively before coding

![breadth first](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s12-03.jpg)

- novices went ==depth== first: identified first problem and solved it (i.e., typed code) before moving on

![depth first](PSYCH%20258/Attachments/p258s12-04.jpg)

### Developing Expertise

Anderson (1988):

- novices use **==weak==-method** procedures:
	- domain-==independent== (can be applied to any domain)
	- require substantial mental effort to perform
	- virtually identical to means-end analysis
		- e.g., driving from Toronto to Vancouver by just heading west
- experts use **domain-==specific==** procedures:
	- combinations of specific problem-solving situations and a series of ==compiled== actions leading to solutions
	- relatively automatically triggered
	- created by successful repetitions
		- e.g., driving from Toronto to Vancouver after developing a plan using a map, researching historic traffic conditions, and considering speed limits to find the most efficient route

K. Anders Ericsson (& Pool, 2016; Ericsson & Charness, 1994):

- studied expert performers in many different domains, like chess, medicine, music, and sports
- expertise is not due to innate talent, extended intense training, or intelligence
- but extended, sustained **deliberate --------**: four general principles underlying performance improvement:
- has well-defined, specific goals
- is focused
- requires immediate feedback
- requires ----------- oneself
- the specific amount varies, depending on the skill
	- e.g., S.F. practiced digit span for about 200 hours
	- e.g., virtuoso pianists: about 25,000 hours
	- e.g., chess masters and Olympic medallists: 10,000 hours

- oversimpified as “10,000 hours” of full-time practice (the “10-year-rule”) by journalist Malcolm Gladwell (2008)

But practice doesn’t always make perfect (Macnamara et al., 2014):

- meta-analysis of 157 studies of sports, music, education, games, and professions
- related time spent practicing to ability
- on average, practice time accounted for just 12% of the variation in performance
- practice had almost nothing to do with ability in -------- classes or professions such as computer programming
- practice had the biggest effect on games such as chess (it explained 26% of performance differences), but it varied greatly (to reach “master” status, one person needed 728 hours whereas another took 16,120 hours)
- however, most of these studies did not measure deliberate practice
- success likely due to other factors like natural talent, general intelligence and ------- memory

---

## Creativity

- definition: the ability to produce novel, ------ ideas
- **---------- thinking**: thinking that proceeds toward a single correct answer

e.g., uses for a brick: to create a bridge, to make a house (all involve using a brick for building)

- **--------- thinking**: generating ideas that are different from one another; moving outward from a problem in many different directions

e.g., uses for a brick: as a doorstop, to smash a window, to cast a shadow, as a topic of conversation (each idea differs from the other)

Wallas (1926): stages of creative thought:

1. **-----------**: gathering information about the problem; characterized by painstaking work, with little progress
2. **----------**: problem set aside; solution may continue to develop unconsciously
3. **------------**: key insight/new idea emerges
4. **verification**: confirmation that new idea leads to a solution

- evidence is equivocal

### Measurement

- J.P. Guilford (1967): creativity is discovering new, unanticipated approaches to a problem (more = better)

**--------- Production Test**: make as many and as varied responses to test item as possible

“Many words begin with an L and end with an N. In one minute, list as many words as possible that have the form L-------N.”

- ---- correlation between individuals judged more creative by coworkers, and score on this test
- Mednick & Mednick (1967): creativity depends on finding new connections among ideas

**------ Associates Test**: link 3 words with a common word:

cookies sixteen heart ------

poke go molasses ------

surprise line birthday ------

- ---- correlation between graduate students judged creative by their advisors, and RAT
- **---------- assessment**: done by expert panel

e.g., artists judge creativity of kids’ drawings

### Contributing Factors

Amabile (1983): motivation

- kids told: a) be as creative as possible; or b) their work would be evaluated, most creative wins
- creativity greater in group a), who were intrinsically motivated
- creativity lesser in group b) due to **--------- motivation**: external rewards and incentives

Roe (1953): intelligence

- creativity generally related to IQ scores (but only up to IQ of ~---)

Mihály Csíkszentmihályi (1996): context

- ------: existing knowledge in a particular area

e.g., physics, music

- -----: social context, including social & public institutions

e.g., collaborators, mentors, rivals

### Integrative Approaches

**Investment theory** (Sternberg & Lubart, 1995):

- “--- ---”: see hidden potential of ideas presumed by others to have little value
- person creatively develops potential of idea to be meaningful
- “---- ----”: value of contribution is recognized; move on
- person has influence by being a step ahead
- component factors:
- processes of intelligence: ability to redefine problems, and think insightfully
- expertise: background knowledge to draw upon
- imaginative -------- skills: recognize patterns/use new perspectives
- venturesome personality: persistent, willing to take risks
- --------- motivation: creativity greater when not for pay
- creative environment: encourages creativity

Gardner (2011a):

- studied biographies of creative individuals
- concluded ----- of the above are important
