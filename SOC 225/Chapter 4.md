# Research in Criminology
- How do we get data about crime in society?
- What are some challenges with crime research?
- Do the statistics collected count what we think they count? (Validity)
- Qualitative vs quantitative research methods
# How much Crime?
- In Canada?
- is the crime rate going up or down?
- How do you know?
- why does the perception of the amount of crime in Canada matter?
# Ethics in Research
- When and where does Ethics find expression?
- What research requires ethical clearance?
	- Involving human subjects
	- why?
## History of Ethics
- What are ethics?
	-  "how we ought to be with others"
	- How should we treat those that we research?
- Nuremburg trials
	- Trials that happened after the war where Nazis were evaluated criminally
	- Nazi scientists were also on trial
	- Criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians
	- Nuremburg Code established in 1948
		- "The **Voluntary consent** of human subjects is absolutely essential"
		- must have *consent*
			- Have to make sure individuals are able to give it
			- Must be able to say "yes i wanna be involved in this research"
			- Consent forms
			- Understand the risks, benefits, and scope of the research
			- must be *informed consent*
			- Able to withdraw from the research at any time
		- must be *voluntary*
			- No coercion
				- Minimal monetary coercion
					- Must be able to answer why we are giving them money, is it to coerced them to be involved?
						- Most of the time, we are paying for their time, data, honesty and "expertise" (as if they were a speaker, and this is a job)
				- No forcing participants
		- Benefits must outweigh the risks
		- This established the basics of university ethics
- **When we are determining if a research project should be funded or accepted, the most important test should be to determine if the ==Benefits of the research outweigh the risks==**
	- Risks to participants, Researcher, and Organization associated with the research (eg. uAlberta)
	- Use the balance of probabilities
		- Based on previous knowledge, chance that the research will produce more benefits than risks.
### 10 Standards of Nuremburg Code
1. Volunteers freely consent to participate
2. Volunteers are fully informed
3. Risks reduced where possible
4. Researchers responsible for protecting participants against remote harm
5. Participants can withdraw from the study any time
6. Qualified researchers
7. Stop the study if adverse effects occur
8. Society should benefit from study findings
9. Human research should be based off of previous animal studies or previous work
10. Study should never begin if there is a reason to believe that death or injury may result
### Declaration of Helsinki
- In 1964, the World Medical Association established recommendations guiding research involving human subjects.
- Issues addressed:
	- Research protocols should be reviewed by independent committee prior to initiation
	- Informed consent from participants
	- Research conducted by medically/scientifically qualified individuals
	- Risks should not exceed benefits
### Infamous studies that changed ethical standards
- Tuskegee experiment (1932-1972)
	- Why was it problematic, what ethical standards were violated?
		- Voluntary Informed consent not collected
			- Consent not given, hid the nature of their research
			- Possible coercion due to free medical checkups, and meals
		- No ability to withdraw
		- Risks greatly outweighed the benefits
		- No protection of participants from harm

		- Not only were there only 72/600 participants alive by the end, many of their wives and children contracted syphilis as well
