# Research in Criminology
- How do we get data about crime in society?
- What are some challenges with crime research?
- Do the statistics collected count what we think they count? (Validity)
- Qualitative vs quantitative research methods
# How much Crime?
- In Canada?
- is the crime rate going up or down?
- How do you know?
- why does the perception of the amount of crime in Canada matter?
# Ethics in Research
- When and where does Ethics find expression?
- What research requires ethical clearance?
	- Involving human subjects
	- why?
## History of Ethics
- What are ethics?
	-  "how we ought to be with others"
	- How should we treat those that we research?
- Nuremburg trials
	- Trials that happened after the war where Nazis were evaluated criminally
	- Nazi scientists were also on trial
	- Criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians
	- Nuremburg Code established in 1948
		- "The **Voluntary consent** of human subjects is absolutely essential"
		- must have *consent*
			- Have to make sure individuals are able to give it
			- Must be able to say "yes i wanna be involved in this research"
			- Consent forms
			- Understand the risks, benefits, and scope of the research
			- must be *informed consent*
			- Able to withdraw from the research at any time
		- must be *voluntary*
			- No coercion
				- Minimal monetary coercion
					- Must be able to answer why we are giving them money, is it to coerced them to be involved?
						- Most of the time, we are paying for their time, data, honesty and "expertise" (as if they were a speaker, and this is a job)
				- No forcing participants
		- Benefits must outweigh the risks
		- This established the basics of university ethics
- **When we are determining if a research project should be funded or accepted, the most important test should be to determine if the ==Benefits of the research outweigh the risks==**
	- Risks to participants, Researcher, and Organization associated with the research (eg. uAlberta)
	- Use the balance of probabilities
		- Based on previous knowledge, chance that the research will produce more benefits than risks.
### 10 Standards of Nuremburg Code
1. Volunteers freely consent to participate
2. Volunteers are fully informed
3. Risks reduced where possible
4. Researchers responsible for protecting participants against remote harm
5. Participants can withdraw from the study any time
6. Qualified researchers
7. Stop the study if adverse effects occur
8. Society should benefit from study findings
9. Human research should be based off of previous animal studies or previous work
10. Study should never begin if there is a reason to believe that death or injury may result
### Declaration of Helsinki
- In 1964, the World Medical Association established recommendations guiding research involving human subjects.
- Issues addressed:
	- Research protocols should be reviewed by independent committee prior to initiation
	- Informed consent from participants
	- Research conducted by medically/scientifically qualified individuals
	- Risks should not exceed benefits
### Infamous Studies that Changed Ethical Standards
- Tuskegee experiment (1932-1972)
	- Why was it problematic, what ethical standards were violated?
		- Voluntary Informed consent not collected
			- Consent not given, hid the nature of their research
			- Possible coercion due to free medical checkups, and meals
		- No ability to withdraw
		- Risks greatly outweighed the benefits
		- No protection of participants from harm
		- Not only were there only 72/600 participants alive by the end, many of their wives and children contracted syphilis as well
		- Most marginalized people in society are the subjects, taken advantage of
- Willowbrook School study (1956-1971)
	- Hepatitis deliberately given to children with intellectual disabilities to track development of disease and develop a vaccine
- Tearoom Trade Study (Laud Humphries)
	- Public washrooms on side of highway used frequently for secret gay sex between men
	- Laud Humphries befriended men and acted as "lookout"
		- Write down licence plate numbers after sexual acts happened
		- Get a cop friend to get the personal info of these people
	- A year later, he used the personal info to find participants, and interview them under the guise of a "study on health"
		- Altered his appearance to do so
	- **deception upon deception upon deception**
	- **Lack of informed consent**
#### Researchers Must Ensure Anonymity
- Anonymity
	- Give pseudonym
	- Alter non important demographic info
- Confidentiality
	- We protect the collected data of the participants, and we do not share it to anyone other those who are prior described
	- Difficult to do so in the criminological world
		- Research has been sapinda by police in the past
		- Anonymized data helps with this
	- Caveats included to protect society and other people
		- Eg. "You can tell me anything about past crimes, but if you tell me about planned future crimes or **any** crime involving children I will have to inform the police."
- Research causes no undue harm to participants
- Informed consent of Participants
- not disguised the true nature/purpose of the research (manipulation)
- **==Benefits outweigh the risks==**
	- Most important thing
## Stanford Prison Experiment
- Ethical standards violated:
	- Consent but not fully informed on the severity of the situation
	- Not informed on risks
	- Not protected against harm
	- Not able to withdraw
	- Cessation of the study if adverse effects did not happen
	- **Risks did not outweigh the benefits**
# Challenges of Researching Crime
- Police cannot record unreported crime or crime of which they are unaware
- Deeper you go into the criminal justice system, the more obvious it becomes that you are collecting stats on the CSJ
	- Prison population stats are more representative of how society responds to crime, but are not a valid measure of the scope and nature of crime
- The crime funnel affects police-recorded crime rate.
	- ![[Pasted image 20240924094550.png]]
	- **How can we get around the problems associated with the crime funnel?**

## How much Crime
- Problematic to count, as it is in secret or goes unreported
	- aka. abuse, domestic violence
- major problem in stats = dark figure of crime
	- crime remains unreported, unrecorded, and/or largely unknown
## Official Statistics – Canadian Uniform Crime Reports
- The goal of Uniform Crime Reports is to provide uniform and comparable national statistics.
- Benefits because it is based on rates, not raw or total numbers
	- **rate** = crime per population, eg: `crimes reported/100,000 people`
	- Allows for comparisons between jurisdictions or over time, and 
	- Is not influenced by differences in population size between jurisdictions, or changes in population size in one jurisdiction.
- **Not accurate of accurate crime amount, simply can be used as a comparison tool over time and across jurisdictions**
---
- Crime rate is staying about the same
- Young offenders commit ~20%$ of crime
- ![[Pasted image 20240924100251.png]]
- Youth crime rate fell dramatically between 2011 and 2021
	- **This does not mean that there is less youth crime necessarily**
	- In 2002,  youth criminal justice act came into effect, and changed the mentality of governing youth crime, and therefore, rates plummeted.
		- Separated violent offenders from non violent property offenders
	- result of widespread decreases in the rates of nearly all reported property and some violent violations
	- ![[Pasted image 20240924100549.png]]
### What Factors Might Influence the Crime Rate
- economic fluctuations
- administrative changes
- demographic changes
	- Less 18-24 y/o = less crime in that group = lower crime rate
---
- Dark Figure
- What types of crime(s) do police tend to focus on?
- Crime is a social construct.
- As a social construct, the labelling of an act as crime is sensitive to variation in:
	- Reporting
	- Policing
	- Definitions
	- Administration
	- Media attention
## Why People Do Not Report their Victimization
- too minor
- police won’t do anything
- inconvenient
- reported to another official
- personal matter
- protecting offender
- Revenge
- Not sure if the behavior is criminal
## What have we learned from victimization studies
- Victimization surveys cannot capture the entire "dark" figure missed by the UCR, but victimization data show that many more Canadians are victimized than is revealed by official statistics
- Some categories of offenders (for example, family members) are less likely to be reported. Victimization surveys go beyond merely counting crime. 
	- They provide data on costs of victimization, financial losses, physical injuries, and fear. 
	- Data allow us to explore various dimensions of seriousness.
### What age group is most at risk for violent crime
![[Pasted image 20240924103213.png]]
- BUT elderly are the most scared of violent crime
