# Chapter 1: Crime, Criminals, and Criminology
Chapter 1 of *Criminology: A Canadian Perspective* (9th edition) is titled "Crime, Criminals, and Criminology" and introduces the study of criminology, the science behind crime and criminal behavior. Below is a detailed summary:

## Key Themes:
- **Definition of Criminology**: The chapter begins by defining criminology as the scientific study of crime, laws, and societal reactions to law violations. It follows the definition provided by Edwin Sutherland and Donald Cressey, viewing criminology as a body of knowledge that examines crime as a social phenomenon and studies processes such as making and breaking laws and societal reactions to violations【8:0†source】.

- **Public Fascination with Crime**: It highlights how crime is a prominent concern in public discourse, influenced by media through movies, TV shows, and news, which often sensationalize criminal behavior. The chapter emphasizes that while crime is a source of entertainment, it is also a serious subject for academic study【8:0†source】.

- **The Sand Brothers Case**: The chapter uses a case study of two brothers, Robert and Danny Sand, who grew up engaging in criminal behavior. This case exemplifies the complexity of understanding criminality as it intersects with family dynamics, societal neglect, and racial issues. Their behavior is explained through a variety of lenses, including psychological, sociological, and biological perspectives【8:0†source】.

- **Social Definition of Crime**: It explains that crime is socially defined, meaning that actions deemed criminal can change over time depending on societal norms. For example, the legal drinking age or societal views on homosexuality have evolved, demonstrating how legal frameworks shift with cultural attitudes【8:0†source】【8:13†source】.

- **Legal and Sociological Definitions of Crime**: A legalistic definition of crime focuses on acts that violate the criminal law and are punishable by fines, imprisonment, or other sanctions. However, sociologists argue that crime should be defined more broadly to include socially harmful behaviors that may not violate formal law but cause harm【8:13†source】【8:19†source】.

- **Green Criminology and Terrorism**: The chapter also touches on new subfields such as green criminology, terrorism studies, and surveillance studies, showcasing how criminology evolves to address contemporary issues like environmental crime and the growing threat of terrorism【8:0†source】.

## Theoretical Perspectives:
- **Conflict vs. Consensus Theories**: Two main theoretical perspectives on lawmaking and criminalization are discussed:
  - **Consensus Theory**: This theory suggests that laws represent the agreed-upon values of society and are established to maintain social order.
  - **Conflict Theory**: It posits that laws are tools used by those in power to maintain control and suppress dissent, often leading to the criminalization of behaviors practiced by marginalized groups【8:0†source】【8:13†source】.

Overall, Chapter 1 sets the foundation for understanding criminology by addressing how crime is defined, perceived, and studied, stressing the importance of studying crime to develop strategies to reduce it and understand its broader societal impact.
