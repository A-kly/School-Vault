### Chapter 1: Crime, Criminals, and Criminology

This chapter introduces criminology as the scientific study of crime and criminals. It explains the fascination Canadians have with crime, reflected in the media and entertainment, and emphasizes that criminology is a serious academic field. The chapter defines criminology, drawing from the work of Sutherland and Cressey, who describe it as studying the processes of lawmaking, lawbreaking, and societal reactions to lawbreaking. Criminologists aim to develop knowledge about crime as a social phenomenon.

The chapter highlights how rules govern human behaviour and can evolve into formal laws. It presents different ways of defining crime, ranging from a strict legal definition to one that considers violations of human rights and places acts of deviance and crime on a continuum.

A key concept introduced is that crime is socially defined, meaning the idea of what constitutes a crime can change over time. The chapter discusses two theoretical perspectives on how acts become criminalized: the **consensus** perspective, which sees laws as reflecting general agreement, and the **conflict** perspective, which views laws as instruments of power.

Additionally, the chapter discusses emerging fields in criminology, such as **green criminology**, which deals with environmental crimes, **terrorism studies**, and **surveillance studies**, reflecting how the discipline continues to evolve with societal changes   .

### Chapter 3: Criminal Law

Chapter 3 delves into the foundations of **criminal law** in Canada. It defines criminal law as a body of rules and principles that designate prohibited behaviours and prescribe penalties. The chapter covers key concepts, such as **actus reus** (the physical element of a crime) and **mens rea** (the mental element), and explores how these elements work together in determining criminal responsibility.

The chapter explains the two main sources of Canadian criminal law: **legislation** and **judicial decisions**. It emphasizes the federal Parliament's exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law and its power to address "public evils" that harm Canadian society. Provincial governments, on the other hand, can legislate in areas like health and education, but their laws do not address inherently wrongful acts.

**Regulatory offences**, also known as **quasi-criminal law**, involve minor offences with less severe penalties, such as fines or short-term imprisonment. These differ from "true crimes," which are considered inherently wrong and subject to more serious consequences.

The chapter also discusses inchoate crimes, like **attempt**, **conspiracy**, and **counseling**, which allow law enforcement to intervene before a crime is completed. The chapter concludes by outlining various defences to criminal charges, such as self-defense and insanity, which can exempt individuals from liability   .
