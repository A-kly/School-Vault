- A **correlate** is “a phenomenon that accompanies another phenomenon & is related in some way to it” (Hartnagel, 2012)
# Do Churches and Ice cream cause crime?
- The more churches in a city, the more crime there is. Thus, churches lead to crime.
- The more ice cream that is consumed, the more crime there is. Thus, ice cream eating leads to crime.
- **third variable problem**
	- a third variable conditions the deviant outcome
	- people erroneously believe that there is a causal relationship between the two primary variables rather than recognize that a third variable can cause both.
- The more churches in a city, the more crime there is. Thus, churches lead to crime.
	- both increased churches and increased crime rates can be explained by larger populations. In bigger cities, there are both more churches and more crime.
- The more ice cream that is consumed, the more crime there is. Thus, ice cream eating leads to crime.
	- Both increased ice cream eating and increased crime rates can be explained by warmer weather.
	- Canada day and crime
# What is a correlation?
- An association
- A relationship between two (or more) variables
	- Positive
	- Negative
- One THING is related to another THING

## Knowing that poverty and crime are correlated, which of these can we conclude?
- A. Crime is one of several causes of poverty.
- B. Poverty is the main cause of crime.
- C. Crime alone causes poverty.
- D. Poverty alone causes crime.
- **E. None of the above**
# What are the STRONGEST CORRELATES?
- **Age and Sex**
	- sex then age
- UNIVERSALLY, YOUNG MALES COMMIT MORE CRIME THAN OLDER PEOPLE.
- “Young man’s game”
# Write down a memory or experience you had as a youth when an adult treated you differently/poorly
- When I was in 7th grade, I misunderstood the directions for an English assignment and asked the teacher if the way that i had done it was acceptable. She ridiculed me in front of the class and had everyone who did the assignment "correctly" to raise their hand, and then asked people to raise their hand if they did it my way. 
# How does the public perceive youth crime?
- focus on young as offenders
	- Victims of youth crime are move likely to be peers, not adults
	- youth = 10% of Canadian pop, but 20% of victims
- emphasizing youth offending
	- 1. distorts thinking about relationship between youth and crime
	- 2. social policies directed more towards punitive measures rather than remedial ones
- Focus on criminal behaviours causes more punitive measures rather then focussing on the situation of the youth in order to improve their circumstance
	- troubling kids vs troubled kids
	- this issue creates policies that end up punishing youth
# How can we explain age and crime correlation?
- Maturation reform:
	- People are less likely to commit crime as they grow older, as conforming to societal norms increases life satisfaction
- adolescence is a period of transition marked by ambiguity
- More prosocial relationships
- Adolescents are not kids or adults and may not be fully committed to conventional values
- The confusion, marginality, and "in-between-ness" of adolescence may be conductive to criminal behaviour
- adults have greater incentive to conform
## Adolescence
- transition time
- develop attachments
- commitments
- more restraints
- more status, crime “costs” more
- added “stake” in conformity
- more likely integrated into society
# Terminology
## Sex
- biological
- given
- ambiguity ignored
- physiological construct
## Gender
- cultural
- “What it means to be male”
- “What it means to be female”
- social expectations
	- masculinity
	- femininity
- social construct
- Gender refers to the socially-derived constructs that describe the categories of "men" and "women" including expected behaviours, roles, and attributes the Western concept of gender recognizes that gender exists on a continuum with individuals identifying as women, men, neither, or both and may change or shift along the continuum over time Many Indigenous nations understand gender and sexuality differently from Western concepts. The term Two-Spirit person is an umbrella term for some Indigenous individuals who identify as having both a female and male spirit within them or whose gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, or spiritual identity is not limited by the binary classification of gender as woman or man
# Gender as a Correlate of Crime
- Males are overrepresented among offenders.
- In Canada in 2014/15, males made up:
	- 80% of defendants in adult criminal court
	- 98% of the accused in sexual assaults
	- 89% of robbery cases
	- 86% of homicide cases
	- 77% of major assault cases
- Females are less likely to be charged with criminal offences.
- **RATES ARE CLOSEST FOR MINOR PROPERTY OFFENCES (SHOPLIFTING, BAD CHEQUES)**
## Women and Crime
- 86% of those accused of homicide in 2016 were male.
- 75% of homicide victims are males.
- Of the 500 persons held in 2013 under the “dangerous offender” law, only one was a woman
- 6% of Canadian federally incarcerated offenders are women (46% are Indigenous)
- Both males and females are more likely to be killed by males.
- Victims of female acts of violence are typically:
	- the spouse or some other intimate partner (36%),
	- a family member (17%)
## Why
- Heimer and De Coster (1999): the gender gap in violent crime is the result of structural positions and cultural processes:
	- Violent delinquency is a function of social learning of violent definitions by males and females.
		- Where do boys learn these roles?
		- https://www.ted.com/talks/colin_stokes_how_movies_teach_manhood
	- Gender differences: boys learn more violent definitions and have more experience with physical violence.
