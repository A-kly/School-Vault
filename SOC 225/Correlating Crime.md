- A **correlate** is “a phenomenon that accompanies another phenomenon & is related in some way to it” (Hartnagel, 2012)
# Do Churches and Ice cream cause crime?
- The more churches in a city, the more crime there is. Thus, churches lead to crime.
- The more ice cream that is consumed, the more crime there is. Thus, ice cream eating leads to crime.
- **third variable problem**
	- a third variable conditions the deviant outcome
	- people erroneously believe that there is a causal relationship between the two primary variables rather than recognize that a third variable can cause both.
- The more churches in a city, the more crime there is. Thus, churches lead to crime.
	- both increased churches and increased crime rates can be explained by larger populations. In bigger cities, there are both more churches and more crime.
- The more ice cream that is consumed, the more crime there is. Thus, ice cream eating leads to crime.
	- Both increased ice cream eating and increased crime rates can be explained by warmer weather.

# Write down a memory or experience you had as a youth when an adult treated you differently/poorly
- When I was in 7th grade, I misunderstood the directions for an English assignment and asked the teacher if the way that i had done it was acceptable. She ridiculed me in front of the class and had everyone who did the assignment "correctly" to raise their hand, and then asked people to raise their hand if they did it my way. 
# How does the public perceive youth crime?
- focus on young as offenders
	- Victims of youth crime are move likely to be peers, not adults
	- youth = 10% of Canadian pop, but 20% of victims
- emphasizing youth offending
	- 1. distorts thinking about relationship between youth and crime
	- 2. social policies directed more towards punitive measures rather than remedial ones
- Focus on criminal behaviours causes more punitive measures rather then focussing on the situation of the youth in order to improve their circumstance
	- troubling kids vs troubled kids
	- this issue creates policies that end up punishing youth
# How can we explain age and crime correlation?
- Maturation reform:
	- People are less likely to commit crime as they grow older, as conforming to societal norms increases life satisfaction
- adolescence is a period of transition marked by ambiguity
- More prosocial relationships
- Adolescents are not kids or adults and may not be fully committed to conventional values
- The confusion, marginality, and "in-between-ness" of adolescence may be conductive to criminal behaviour
- adults have greater incentive to conform
## Adolescence
- transition time
- develop attachments
- commitments
- more restraints
- more status, crime “costs” more
- added “stake” in conformity
- more likely integrated into society
