# PUT
- Like POST but does not handle the request, it is the request
- Sending a resource, putting it on the URI link that I'm calling
- adds / relaces new entities in database
# DELETE
- Opposite of PUT
- Erases the value of the URI
- request body is usually empty

# HTTP user agents
- Client/browser
	- Tells server about kind of browser that is accessing page
- Can allow for fingerprinting and tracking, this may be nice sometimes for preferences or personalization
