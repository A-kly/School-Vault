	- We all are responsible for our own computers
	- ISPs are responsible for connecting us to WWW

	- Lots of edge cases
	- Websites are **public private spaces**
		- Malls are a good equivalent example
		- Accessible to the general public, but is a private space
		- if you break rules, you can be banned
		- They have the right to do this
	- Government regulating institutions that are in charge of regulating these spaces
	- Calls for regulation of internet, and ai, but it's difficult

- How has it changed us?
	- How we communicate and behave
## Cyberspace and AI
- Internet is now dominated by computers
