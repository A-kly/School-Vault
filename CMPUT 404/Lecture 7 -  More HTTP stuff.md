# Administrivia
- **==Final is April 16th at 1:00 pm==**
	- final is 1.5 hours
- TAs have updated the pelican repository, look online and pull again (url/repo might be different???)
- to get python to work on cybera:
	- hub.docker.com
		- Search for python to get a docker container with the right python version
		- `docker pull python` then add tag to pull an entire container
	- conda is used to create virtual conda environments with a specific python version
		- look up conda cheat sheet to find info on it
		- mini-conda is good
		- can be big in terms of file size so maybe use on local machine
- Make sure to use NVM for the node lab assignment
# Server headers
- `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`
	- whether we alow js running in browser to make requests with cookies
- `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: true`
	- same as the other one for headers
- *more online, too fast, can't keep up!*

	- if there is a violation in the security policy, send a report to a specific url
- Disconnections (aside)
	- If ghosted, Passive disconnection
	- If formal breakup, active disconnection
- keep alive
	- keep connection alive for a max of `time` if no responses
- Proxy authenticate & authorize
	- Gives user power to interact with server
	- Ask user to log into proxy server, as a first line of defence
	- proxy is middle man between server and client
	- Acts as a load balancer sometimes too
- referrer-policy:  no-referrer-when-downgrade
	- when i go back a URI directory, don't refer
- Extra headers
	- Start with `X-`
	- we are not abiding by a given protocol, we are adding on top of the protocol ourselves

# Proxies
## Forward
- Forwards incomming http requests to you
- rare
- set up by you
- Basically like a consumer VPN
## Reverse proxy
- common
- forwards http requests to server
- how that one girl explained how she accessed cybera throught the cybera vpn
- caddy & nginx
	- use these for project
