- Use W3schools to learn and experiment
- Use fiddle to look at live js stuff
- Use browser console
- JS runs locally on client
	- Can update info quickly
- Looks a bit like python
	- `function` instead of `def`
- Closure
	- Inner functions can see outer variables
	- outer functions **cannot** see inner variables
- Scope
	- By default, variables are always global
	- `var` makes variables local to FUNCTION
	- `let` is for a variable used only in a small context (let, while, etc.)
	- `const` fixed value
	- **Scope is defined by curly brackets**
- Type coercion
	- "1" + 1 in python = ERROR
	- "1" + 1 in JS = "11"
