==Skipped this chunk of lecture 1 for antifreeze stuff==

# Sociology and the study of social problems
- the study of social problems is as old as sociology itself
	- Urbanization, crime, industrialism, political revolutions, (class) inequality, etc.
# Elements of social problems
- Two elements, objective and subjective
	- **Objective:** empirically observed *conditions* that affect wellbeing of chunk of pop
		- eg, crime, poverty, abuse
		- shows that the condition exists and that it harms people
		- cause-effect can be studies without making moral judgement (serious vs trivial)
		- count and measure incidence with science
		- can make and test theories about change
	- **Subjective:** evaluation of conditions by members of society, they each have an opinion on whether it is an important problem worth considering 
		- moral labels are applied to a particular act or situation ("wrong", "immoral", etc.)
		- the accounts people give for these acts/situations
		- personal beliefs, tastes, reality
		- social consequences of people's actions
# Social problems and the sociological imagination
**sociological imagination:** ability to see connections between our own life (micro events) and the social world that we live in (macro events)
- **Micro-level analysis:** focus on interactions between individuals in small groups
- **Macro-level analysis:** focus on societal level -
