# Learning
- an enduring or durable change in behaviour or mental processes due to experience
	- Relatively permanent  
	- Causes a change in behaviour  
	- Occurs due to interactions with the environment
# Unlearned Behaviours (That can be connected to other stimuli via learning)
- **Innate:** something inborn or naturally occurring
- **Reflex:** stimulus-response relationship which is either learned* or innate and indicates that behavior that happens automatically
	- Reflex arc = unlearned
# Elicited Behaviour
- Occurs in response to environmental stimuli
- Examples: 
	- Pupils constrict when exposed to bright light  
	- Withdrawal response to touching something hot  
	- Food in mouth elicits salivation  
	- Sneeze if particle of dust enters your nose
## Adaptive Value of Elicited Behaviour?

# Modal Action Patterns (MAP)
- Species-typical response patterns or “instincts”; genetically programmed
- Rather than single actions, a sequence of behaviours
- Often associated with fitness-related tasks/events

## Eliciting Stimuli
- Which stimulus initiates the modal action pattern?
- **Sign Stimulus (aka releasing stimulus):** features necessary to elicit the response
- **Supernormal Stimulus:** exaggerated sign stimulus that elicits more vigorous response
### Pecking Response in Gulls
![[Pasted image 20250116162814.png]]
- Simulated gull heads on the right, graph of number of pecks
- presence or absence of red is what matters the most
- red stick is supernormal stimulus
- "red" is signed stimulus
### Aggression in Sticklebacks
![[Pasted image 20250116163053.png]]
- No attacks with no red (realistic fish)
- vaguely fish and red
	- more attacks
- closer to fish, more red
	- EVEN more attacks
## Exploiting MAPs

- Cuccos simulate other chicks with Larger, extra yellow beak and red mouth, supernormal stimulus
# Learned Behaviours
## Types of Learning
- Event-alone learning  
	- Habituation and sensitization  
- Event-event learning  
	- Classical (Pavlovian) conditioning  
- Behaviour-event learning  
	- Instrumental (operant) conditioning  
- Social learning  
	- Observational learning
## Event-Alone Learning
### Learning for Reflexes?
- Descartes said that reflex responses occur the same way every time  
- Not the case – repeated stimulation can alter the magnitude of the behavioural response
### Habituation
- process by which we respond less strongly over time to repeated stimuli  
- Highly specific to the stimulus producing it  
- Not habituation:  
	- **Sensory adaptation:** Reduction in sensitivity of the sense organs caused by repeated stimulation
	- **Fatigue:** Decrease in behaviour due to repeated or excessive use of muscles
- Biological mechanism of habituation discovered by Eric Kandel in the sea slug, Aplysia
### Sensitization
- increase in the strength of a response to a repeated stimulus
- Not specific to one stimulus  
	- Can result from repeated presentations of a stimulus or by arousal from extraneous stimuli

### Visual Attention in Infants
- Human infant visual fixation  
- Infants fixated longer to complex rather than simple stimuli across trials

## Rats in background noise, habituation vs sensitization
![[Pasted image 20250116164756.png]]
## Adaptive Value
- Habituation
	- Reduced responding to things constant in your environment
		- Attention drawn to new things
- Sensitization
	- Increased responsiveness to things in distracting environments (e.g., loud, visually busy)
		- Ready for danger
# Event-Event Learning
![[Pasted image 20250121153424.png]]
## Classical Conditioning
- Classical, Respondent, or Pavlovian conditioning
	- Form of learning in which a neutral stimulus comes to signal the occurrence of a second stimulus
	- Behaviours are elicited (brought about by) antecedent stimuli
	- Conditioning process involves manipulation of antecedent stimuli
### Useful Terminology
- Elicits
	- brings about
- Stimulus
	- anything in the environment that (a) we can detect, (b) is measurable, and (c) can evoke a response or behavior
- Association
	- a relationship between two stimuli
- Acquisition
	- time while an association is being learned
### Classical Conditioning Terms
- **Unconditioned Stimulus (US)**
	- Biologically significant stimulus that already has a response associated with it
	- eg. food, pain
- **Unconditioned Response (UR)**
	- Response naturally associated with the unconditioned stimulus
	- eg. Salivation, Startle
- **Neutral Stimulus (NS)**
	- A stimulus that does not naturally elicit a response
	- eg. Tone; chime; bell

# Behaviour-Event Learning
## E. L. Thorndike’s Law of Effect
- “If a response, in the presence of a stimulus, is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond between stimulus and response will be strengthened.”
	- Satisfaction = stamping in  
	- Discomfort = stamping out
## Operant Conditioning
- **Operant (Instrumental) Conditioning:** learning that is controlled by the consequences of the organisms behaviour
![[Pasted image 20250121154043.png]]
## Stimuli, Responses, & Outcomes
- **Antecedent:** something detectable in the environment that set the occasion to respond  
- **Behaviour:** activity that can be repeated, measured, and has an impact on the environment  
- **Consequences:** stimuli that can increase or decrease the probability of future behavior\

# Social Learning
## Bandura and Social Learning
- A. Bandura
	- studied kindergarten students to establish observational learning
- Social (observational) learning
	- we understand what to do by watching others
		- Vicarious conditioning occurs by an organism watching another organism (a model) be conditioned
## A Classic Observational Learning Study

## Social Learning and Cognition
- Many models rely on cognitive explanations
- Less of a focus in this course
