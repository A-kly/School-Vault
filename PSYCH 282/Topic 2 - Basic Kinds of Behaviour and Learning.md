# Learning
- an enduring or durable change in behaviour or mental processes due to experience
	- Relatively permanent  
	- Causes a change in behaviour  
	- Occurs due to interactions with the environment
# Unlearned Behaviours (That can be connected to other stimuli via learning)
- **Innate:** something inborn or naturally occurring
- **Reflex:** stimulus-response relationship which is either learned* or innate and indicates that behavior that happens automatically
	- Reflex arc = unlearned
# Elicited Behaviour
- Occurs in response to environmental stimuli
- Examples: 
	- Pupils constrict when exposed to bright light  
	- Withdrawal response to touching something hot  
	- Food in mouth elicits salivation  
	- Sneeze if particle of dust enters your nose
## Adaptive Value of Elicited Behaviour?

# Modal Action Patterns (MAP)
- Species-typical response patterns or “instincts”; genetically programmed
- Rather than single actions, a sequence of behaviours
- Often associated with fitness-related tasks/events

## Eliciting Stimuli
- Which stimulus initiates the modal action pattern?
- **Sign Stimulus (aka releasing stimulus):** features necessary to elicit the response
- **Supernormal Stimulus:** exaggerated sign stimulus that elicits more vigorous response
### Pecking Response in Gulls
![[Pasted image 20250116162814.png]]
- Simulated gull heads on the right, graph of number of pecks
- presence or absence of red is what matters the most
- red stick is supernormal stimulus
- "red" is signed stimulus
### Aggression in Sticklebacks
![[Pasted image 20250116163053.png]]
- No attacks with no red (realistic fish)
- vaguely fish and red
	- more attacks
- closer to fish, more red
	- EVEN more attacks
## Exploiting MAPs

- Cuccos simulate other chicks with Larger, extra yellow beak and red mouth, supernormal stimulus
# Learned Behaviours
## Types of Learning
- Event-alone learning  
	- Habituation and sensitization  
- Event-event learning  
	- Classical (Pavlovian) conditioning  
- Behaviour-event learning  
	- Instrumental (operant) conditioning  
- Social learning  
	- Observational learning
## Event-Alone Learning
### Learning for Reflexes?
- Descartes said that reflex responses occur the same way every time  
- Not the case – repeated stimulation can alter the magnitude of the behavioural response
### Habituation
- process by which we respond less strongly over time to repeated stimuli  
- Highly specific to the stimulus producing it  
- Not habituation:  
	- **Sensory adaptation:** Reduction in sensitivity of the sense organs caused by repeated stimulation
	- **Fatigue:** Decrease in behaviour due to repeated or excessive use of muscles
- Biological mechanism of habituation discovered by Eric Kandel in the sea slug, Aplysia
### Sensitization
- increase in the strength of a response to a repeated stimulus
- Not specific to one stimulus  
	- Can result from repeated presentations of a stimulus or by arousal from extraneous stimuli
