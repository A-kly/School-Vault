# Learning
- an enduring or durable change in behaviour or mental processes due to experience
	- Relatively permanent  
	- Causes a change in behaviour  
	- Occurs due to interactions with the environment
# Unlearned Behaviours (That can be connected to other stimuli via learning)
- **Innate:** something inborn or naturally occurring
- **Reflex:** stimulus-response relationship which is either learned* or innate and indicates that behavior that happens automatically
	- Reflex arc = unlearned
# Elicited Behaviour
- Occurs in response to environmental stimuli
- Examples: 
	- Pupils constrict when exposed to bright light  
	- Withdrawal response to touching something hot  
	- Food in mouth elicits salivation  
	- Sneeze if particle of dust enters your nose

# Modal Action Patterns (MAP)
- Species-typical response patterns or “instincts”; genetically programmed
- Rather than single actions, a sequence of behaviours
- Often associated with fitness-related tasks/events

## Eliciting Stimuli
- Which stimulus initiates the modal action pattern?
- **Sign Stimulus (aka releasing stimulus):** features necessary to elicit the response
- **Supernormal Stimulus:** exaggerated sign stimulus that elicits more vigorous response
