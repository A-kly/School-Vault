# Operant (instrumental) Conditioning
- learning that is controlled by the consequences of the organisms behaviour

## Reinforcement
- Process in which a behaviour is strengthened by the immediate consequence that reliably follows its occurrence
	- Strengthened = more likely to occur again in the future
- Thorndike’s Law of Effect
	- “If a response, in the presence of a stimulus, is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond between stimulus and response will be strengthened.”
		- Satisfaction = stamping in
		- Discomfort = stamping out
		- If response in presence of a stimulus is followed by satisfying event, the association between S and R is strengthened
		- If response is followed by annoying event, association is weakened
- Skinner’s operant boxes

### Is the Behaviour Strengthened?
- Do we observe:
	- Increase in frequency
	- Increase in duration
	- Increase in intensity
	- Increase in speed (decrease in latency)
### What is Operant Behaviour?
- **Operant (Behaviour)**
	- A behaviour that is strengthened through the process of reinforcement
		- AKA Operant response; instrumental behaviour, etc.
- Acts on environement to produce a consequence
- if consequence strengthens behaviour, it's a reinforcer
- **Operant learning**
	- change in a behaviour as a function of the consequences that followed it

### Escape and Avoidance

- **Escape** = do something to *stop* stimulus
- **Avoidance** = do something to *prevent* stimulus
# Things to Keep in Mind
- Reinforcement is NOT a theory
- Reinforcement IS a functional description
- Reinforcement is NOT circular
	- Incorrect Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) increased the probability of the response (e.g., lever pressing) because it was reinforcing.”
		- Can't use the definition of reinforcer as a reason, Don
	- Correct Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) functioned as a reinforcer for the response (e.g., lever pressing).”
	- Correct Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) reinforced the response (e.g., lever pressing).”
