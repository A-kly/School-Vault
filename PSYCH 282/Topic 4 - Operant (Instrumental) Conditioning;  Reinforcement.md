## Reinforcement
- Process in which a behaviour is strengthened by the immediate consequence that reliably follows its occurrence
	- Strengthened = more likely to occur again in the future
- Thorndike’s Law of Effect
	- “If a response, in the presence of a stimulus, is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond between stimulus and response will be strengthened.”
		- Satisfaction = stamping in
		- Discomfort = stamping out
		- If response in presence of a stimulus is followed by satisfying event, the association between S and R is strengthened
		- If response is followed by annoying event, association is weakened
- Skinner’s operant boxes
