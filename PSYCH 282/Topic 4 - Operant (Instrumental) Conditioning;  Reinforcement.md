# Operant (instrumental) Conditioning
- learning that is controlled by the consequences of the organisms behaviour

## Reinforcement
- Process in which a behaviour is strengthened by the immediate consequence that reliably follows its occurrence
	- Strengthened = more likely to occur again in the future
- Thorndike’s Law of Effect
	- “If a response, in the presence of a stimulus, is followed by a satisfying state of affairs, the bond between stimulus and response will be strengthened.”
		- Satisfaction = stamping in
		- Discomfort = stamping out
		- If response in presence of a stimulus is followed by satisfying event, the association between S and R is strengthened
		- If response is followed by annoying event, association is weakened
- Skinner’s operant boxes

### Is the Behaviour Strengthened?
- Do we observe:
	- Increase in frequency
	- Increase in duration
	- Increase in intensity
	- Increase in speed (decrease in latency)
### What is Operant Behaviour?
- **Operant (Behaviour)**
	- A behaviour that is strengthened through the process of reinforcement
		- AKA Operant response; instrumental behaviour, etc.
- Acts on environement to produce a consequence
- if consequence strengthens behaviour, it's a reinforcer
- **Operant learning**
	- change in a behaviour as a function of the consequences that followed it

### Escape and Avoidance
![[Pasted image 20250128161155.png]]
- **Escape** = do something to *stop* stimulus
- **Avoidance** = do something to *prevent* stimulus
# Things to Keep in Mind
- Reinforcement is NOT a theory
- Reinforcement IS a functional description
- Reinforcement is NOT circular
	- Incorrect Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) increased the probability of the response (e.g., lever pressing) because it was reinforcing.”
		- Can't use the definition of reinforcer as a reason, Don't do this
	- Correct Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) functioned as a reinforcer for the response (e.g., lever pressing).”
	- Correct Usage: “The consequence (e.g., food) reinforced the response (e.g., lever pressing).”
- The explanatory power of “reinforcement” comes from discovering that:
	- the stimuli that will function as a reinforcer.
	- the conditions that allow a stimulus to have a reinforcing function.
- “Increase the probability of” is often shortened to “strengthened”
# How Do We Look at Operant Behaviour? Pause for Methodologies
## Examining Operant Behaviour
- Discrete Trial Procedure
	- Instrumental response produced once per trial
	- Each training trial ends with removal of the animal from the apparatus
![[Pasted image 20250128162710.png]]
- Free-Operant Procedure
	- Animals remain in apparatus and can make many responses
	- No intervention by the experimenter
		- Developed by BF Skinner

- Peck the right hole for the reward
![[Pasted image 20250128163728.png]]
- Chickadee is supposed to hop at male call, and do nothing for female
	- gets food for correct hop
## Cumulative Record
- Based on old cumulative recorder device (1957)
	- Constant paper output, pen jumps with each
![[Pasted image 20250128163927.png]]
- Plot of cumulative responses (y-axis) over time (x-axis)

# Qualities of the Reinforcer and Reinforcement Process
## Two Types of Reinforcer
1. Unconditional (Primary) Reinforcer
	- A reinforcer that acquired its properties as a function of species evolutionary history.
	- Usually depends on some amount of deprivation.
	- Often species specific!
2. Conditional (Secondary) Reinforcer:
	- Otherwise neutral stimuli or events that have acquired the ability to reinforce due to a contingent relationship with other, typically unconditional, reinforcers
## Variables Affecting Reinforcement
- Immediacy
	- A stimulus is more effective as a reinforcer when it is deliver immediately after the behaviour.
- Specific Reinforcer Used
	- e.g., Chocolate > Sunflower seeds
- Task Characteristics
	- e.g., Reinforce a pigeon pecking for food vs. a hawk pecking for food
	- hawks are less likely to peck normally, so use something more "normal" for them
- Contingency
	- A stimulus is more effective as a reinforcer when it is delivered contingent on the behaviour.
	- The degree of correlation between a behaviour and its consequence.
	- ![[Pasted image 20250130160617.png]]
- Contiguity
	- Nearness of events in time (temporal contiguity) or space (spatial contiguity)
		- High contiguity often referred to as “pairing”
	- Less contiguity (i.e., longer delays) between the operant response and the reinforcer, diminishes the effectiveness of the reinforcer
		- Well described by the “Hyperbolic Decay Function”
