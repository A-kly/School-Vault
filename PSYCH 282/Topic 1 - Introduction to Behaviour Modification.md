# What is behaviour Modification?
- Field of psychology dealing with analyzing and modifying behaviour
	- Increase or decrease in a particular behaviour
- Aka applied behaviour analysis
- Why behaviour?
- How do we make change?
# What is behaviour?
- **Behaviourist**: overt (external) actions
- **Cognitive Psychologist**: overt and covert (internal, hidden) actions
# How do we define behaviour?
- Involves **Action**
	- jump, speak, pull
- Is not static or characteristic label
	- Angry, Calm
- Has measurable dimensions
	- **Frequency**
		- eg, dob barks at door
	- **Duration**
		- how long a kid cries
	- **Intensity**
		- How much grip strength of angry teen
	- **Latency**
		- how long **UNTIL** behaviour happens
	- *MUST define SPECIFIC behaviour*
- Behaviour is observed, described and recorded
	- observer detects when action occurs
	- observer can describe and record as it occurs
- Behaviour impacts environment
	- physical and social
	- effects may be obvious or not
- Behaviour is lawful
	- follows predictable rules
	- environmental factors affect behaviour consistently
		- improves understanding, prediction and modification
- Behaviour can be overt or covert
	- Can be obvious (put your hand up and teacher calls on you) or can be internal/hidden (only affects the person who did the behaviour)
# Behaviour Modification Characteristics
- Focus on behaviour, rather than a personal characteristic or trait  
- **Target behaviour:** behavior you want to change  
- **Behavioural excess:** undesirable behaviour you want to decrease  
- **Behavioural deficit:** desirable behaviour you want to increase
- **Experimental Analysis of Behaviour** (aka, behaviour analysis)
	- Study of behaviour
	- originally developed from skinner's experimental research
- **Applied Behaviour analysis**
	- study of behaviour to change behaviour
	- targeted at human behaviour
- Emphasis on current environmental events
	- Antecedents and consequences
	- before and after
	- Alter controlling variables once they are identified
		- Changes the relationship between controlling variables and behaviour
- Clear and detailed descriptions of procedures
	- What ==exactly== are we doing and meaning
- Treatment implemented by non-professionals
- Measure behaviour change
	- Short- and long-term
- No real focus on past, assume current environment and recent events as best explanation
- rejects hypothetical underlying cause
	- Don't need internal explanation when external is sufficient
# Brief History Review
![[Pasted image 20250109155228.png]]
## Edward Thorndike
- Comparative psychologist
- Puzzle box experiments
	- Animals fed after leaving box, food strengthened association between situation (S) and latch-opening response (R)
- **Law of effect**
	- If a response is followed by a satisfying event, the S-R connection is strengthened
	- If a response is followed by bad event, the S-R connection is made more weak
## John B. Watson
- Established behaviourism
- "psych should be about only observable behaviour"
- Stimulus-response psychology  
	- Environmental events (stimuli) elicit responses
## Ivan B. Pavlov
- Did experiments to uncover processes of classical (respondent) conditioning
- Demonstrated that a reflex (salivation of food) could be conditioned to a neutral stimulus (metronome sound)
	- transferred through association between stimuli
## B.F. Skinner
- Expanded the field of behaviourism
- Stressed that while classical (respondent) conditioning described stimuli that elicited responses, operant was about the consequences of a behaviour determines the future occurrence of that behaviour
- Elaborated the basic principles of operant behaviour
	- The foundation of behaviour modification

# Process of Behaviour assessment
1. Define target behaviour
2. determine how it will be recorded
## Defining target behaviour
- **Operational definition**
	- specifies exactly how we measure
	- objective and unambiguous
	- examples:
		- Label: Salivation
		- Operational Definition: Number of milligrams of saliva absorbed by cotton balls (of size X) placed in a particular area in the mouth for specified period of time
	- must be practical and useful
	- should not reference internal states, feelings or motivations.
## Who records the behaviour
- **Independent observer**
	- person beside the person
- **Self-monitoring**
	- Client observes and records behaviour
- **Remote monitoring**
	- Using recording device
- lots of ethics concerns
## When do we record behaviour?
- Consider nature of behaviour
	- all the time or certain times?
	- do we care how often, or just if it occurs?
	- can we extrapolate from a small window?
- Consider the observer
	- Are they only able to observe at certain times?
- **Continuous recording**
	- record every instance of the behaviour over period
	- ![[Pasted image 20250114155429.png]]
- **Sample recording**
	- Look for some occurrences of behaviour
	- Interval recording
		- Partial-Interval Recording: Document if the target behaviour occurred during any part of the interval
		- Whole-Interval Recording: Document if the target
behaviour occurs during the entire interval
		- Frequency-Within-Interval Recording: Document
frequency of the target behaviour within consecutive
intervals of time in the observation period
	- Time sample recording
