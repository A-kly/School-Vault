# What is behaviour Modification?
- Field of psychology dealing with analyzing and modifying behaviour
	- Increase or decrease in a particular behaviour
- Aka applied behaviour analysis
- Why behaviour?
- How do we make change?
# What is behaviour?
- **Behaviourist**: overt (external) actions
- **Cognitive Psychologist**: overt and covert (internal, hidden) actions
# How do we define behaviour?
- Involves **Action**
	- jump, speak, pull
- Is not static or characteristic label
	- Angry, Calm
- Has measurable dimensions
	- **Frequency**
		- eg, dob barks at door
	- **Duration**
		- how long a kid cries
	- **Intensity**
		- How much grip strength of angry teen
	- **Latency**
		- how long **UNTIL** behaviour happens
	- *MUST define SPECIFIC behaviour*
- Behaviour is observed, described and recorded
	- observer detects when action occurs
	- observer can describe and record as it occurs
- Behaviour impacts environment
	- physical and social
	- effects may be obvious or not
- Behaviour is lawful
	- follows predictable rules
	- environmental factors affect behaviour consistently
		- improves understanding, prediction and modification
- Behaviour can be overt or covert
	- Can be obvious (put your hand up and teacher calls on you) or can be internal/hidden (only affects the person who did the behaviour)
# Behaviour Modification Characteristics
- Focus on behaviour, rather than a personal characteristic or trait  
- **Target behaviour:** behavior you want to change  
- **Behavioural excess:** undesirable behaviour you want to decrease  
- **Behavioural deficit:** desirable behaviour you want to increase
- **Experimental Analysis of Behaviour** (aka, behaviour analysis)
	- Study of behaviour
	- originally developed from skinner's experimental research
- **Applied Behaviour analysis**
	- study of behaviour to change behaviour
	- targeted at human behaviour
- Emphasis on current environmental events
	- Antecedents and consequences
	- before and after
	- Alter controlling variables once they are identified
		- Changes the relationship between controlling variables and behaviour
- Clear and detailed descriptions of procedures
	- What ==exactly== are we doing and meaning
- Treatment implemented by non-professionals
- Measure behaviour change
	- Short- and long-term
- No real focus on past, assume current environment and recent events as best explanation
- rejects hypothetical underlying cause
	- Don't need internal explanation when external is sufficient
# Brief History Review
![[Pasted image 20250109155228.png]]
## Edward Thorndike
- Comparative psychologist
- Puzzle box experiments
	- Animals fed after leaving box, food strengthened association between situation (S) and latch-opening response (R)
- **Law of effect**
	- If a response is followed by a satisfying event, the S-R connection is strengthened
	- If a response is followed by bad event, the S-R connection is made more weak
## John B. Watson
- Established behaviourism
- "psych should be about only observable behaviour"
- Stimulus-response psychology  
	- Environmental events (stimuli) elicit responses
## Ivan B. Pavlov
- Did experiments to uncover processes of classical (respondent) conditioning
- Demonstrated that a reflex (salivation of food) could be conditioned to a neutral stimulus (metronome sound)
	- transferred through association between stimuli
## B.F. Skinner
- Expanded the field of behaviourism
- Stressed that while classical (respondent) conditioning described stimuli that elicited responses, operant was about the consequences of a behaviour determines the future occurrence of that behaviour
- Elaborated the basic principles of operant behaviour
	- The foundation of behaviour modification

# Process of Behaviour assessment
1. Define target behaviour
2. determine how it will be recorded
## Defining target behaviour
- **Operational definition**
	- specifies exactly how we measure
	- objective and unambiguous
	- examples:
		- Label: Salivation
		- Operational Definition: Number of milligrams of saliva absorbed by cotton balls (of size X) placed in a particular area in the mouth for specified period of time
	- must be practical and useful
	- should not reference internal states, feelings or motivations.
## Who records the behaviour
- **Independent observer**
	- person beside the person
- **Self-monitoring**
	- Client observes and records behaviour
- **Remote monitoring**
	- Using recording device
- lots of ethics concerns
## When do we record behaviour?
- Consider nature of behaviour
	- all the time or certain times?
	- do we care how often, or just if it occurs?
	- can we extrapolate from a small window?
- Consider the observer
	- Are they only able to observe at certain times?
- **Continuous recording**
	- record every instance of the behaviour over period
	- ![[Pasted image 20250114155429.png]]
- **Sample recording**
	- Look for some occurrences of behaviour
	- **Interval recording**
		- Record whether the target behaviour occurs within certain time intervals
		- **Partial-Interval Recording:** Document if the target behaviour occurred during any part of the interval
		- **Whole-Interval Recording:** Document if the target behaviour occurs during the entire interval
		- **Frequency-Within-Interval Recording:** Document frequency of the target behaviour within consecutive intervals of time in the observation period
		- ![[Pasted image 20250114155702.png]]
	- **Time sample recording**
		- Divide observation period into intervals of time but only observe the behaviour during part of each interval
		- **Momentary Time Sample Recording (MTS):** Records behaviour only if it occurs at the exact instant the interval ends
		- ![[Pasted image 20250114160004.png]]
- **Product Recording (aka Permanent Product Recording)**
	- Record tangible outcomes (products) that result from the occurrence of the behaviour
	- Not technically a direct behaviour
## Where is behaviour recorded?
- Natural setting
	- more representative of target behaviour
	- harder to manipulate behaviour
- Analogue or artificial setting
	- Not part of daily routine
	- less of a good representation of target behaviour
	- more controlled environment
	- easier to manipulate variables
## Important considerations
- Process of observation can change behaviour
	- not representative of normal behaviour
- **Reactivity**
	- Behaviour changes as a result of observation
### Reduce reactivity
- Wait until observer becomes accustomed to the observed
- One way observation is another option
	- Has ethical issues
	- one way mirrors for example
- Self-monitoring may lead to changes
	- Can be used as a treatment
### Interobserver Agreement (IOA)
- Is the recording consistent?
- How do we evaluate this
	1. Two observers record
	2. compare recordings
	3. calculate agreement
# Research Designs
- How to read a graph
	- lame as hell, not needed
## The research method
1.  Measure dependent variable
2. manipulate independent variable and demonstrate a change
3. Eliminate confounding variables if possible
4. Replicate
## A-B design
- A = baseline
- B =  treatment
- **Not a true research design** > No replication
- Does not demonstrate a functional relationship
	- Used in clinical practice, self-management projects
![[Pasted image 20250114162939.png]]
## A-B-A-B Reversal Designs
- Remove treatment; go back to ‘baseline’
- Implement treatment again
- Demonstrates a functional relationship
![[Pasted image 20250114162809.png]]
## Multiple-Baseline Designs
- **Multiple baseline subjects**
	- 2+ subjects with same target behavior
	- Treatment is staggered over time across subjects
		- i.e., baseline lengths are different
- **Multiple baseline behaviours**
	- 2+ behaviors of same subject
	- Treatment is staggered across behaviors
- **Multiple baseline settings**
	- 2+ settings with same subject AND same target behavior
	- Treatment is staggered across settings
## Alternating-Treatment Design
- Baseline/Treatment implemented on alternating days or sessions, for the same amount of time
	- (e.g., one day each)
![[Pasted image 20250114163149.png]]
## Changing-Criterion Designs
- Baseline and treatment phase
- Different from A-B design:  
	- Within treatment phase, sequential performance criteria are specified  
		- Successive goal levels for target behavior  
- Functional relationship is demonstrated when behavior matches performance criteria
![[Pasted image 20250116154035.png]]
- **Basically changing between levels of treatment, not going back to baseline**
# Functional Assessment
- Determine why behaviour occurs (or does not occur)
- Requires a functional understanding of the stimuli in the environment that influences behaviour
![[Pasted image 20250116154315.png]]
## The term contingency
- **A : B --> C**
	- Antecedent (Stimulus) : Behaviour (Response) --> Consequence (Outcome)
	- Example:
		- With friends : tell stories --> friends laugh
		- With parents : tell stories --> no laughs, reprimands
		- Outcome: You are more likely to tell stories to friends but not to parents
### Antecedents vs Consequences
- Antecedents
	- Stimuli that change probability of behaviour
	- Presence influences behaviour
- Consequences
	- Strengthens or weakens behaviour
	- behaviour is more or less likely in the future
		- Repertoire altering effect
### Assessing Antecedents
- When, where, with whom, and in what circumstances or situations does the behavior occur?
	- context, predicting stimuli, circumstances, time of day, etc.
### Assessing Behaviours
- Problem Behaviours
	- Relevant Variables (e.g., intensity, latency,  topography, etc.)
- Alternative Behaviours
### Assessing Consequences
For both problem and alternative behaviours  
• Assess social and environmental (automatic)  
consequences  
• Consider the...  
• Schedule of reinforcement  
• Magnitude of reinforcement  
• Immediacy of reinforcement
