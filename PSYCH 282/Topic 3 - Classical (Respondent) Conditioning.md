# Unconditioned Stimuli and Responses
![[Pasted image 20250121162244.png]]
# The Unconditioned Stimulus
- Can be classified as:
	- Appetitive: a stimulus the animal finds pleasant
		- E.g., food, play, etc.
	- Aversive: a stimulus the animal finds unpleasant
		- E.g., loud sound, darkness, etc.
# A Good Unconditioned Stimulus
- To be effective, the unconditioned stimulus should evoke a strong bodily response
	- E.g., pain, drugs, loud noise
- The more intense the unconditioned stimulus, the easier to produce a conditioned response
	- Though there is a limit

# Temporal  Relationship
## Short-Delay Conditioning
- CS presentation alone, but US overlaps shortly after onset
- Usually most effective conditioning procedure
![[Pasted image 20250123160101.png]]
## Long-Delay Conditioning
- CS and US overlap, but CS is on for longer time  
- CS becomes an imprecise predictor of US
![[Pasted image 20250123160131.png]]
## Trace Conditioning
- No overlap between CS and US  
- Temporal Contiguity matters
![[Pasted image 20250123160207.png]]
## Simultaneous Conditioning
- CS and US onset is at the same time  
- Less common in the real world  
- Less effective than Delayed and Trace conditioning

## Backward Conditioning
- US occurs before CS
- Results are inconsistent
