# The Unconditioned Stimulus
- Can be classified as:
	- Appetitive: a stimulus the animal finds pleasant
		- E.g., food, play, etc.
	- Aversive: a stimulus the animal finds unpleasant
		- E.g., loud sound, darkness, etc.
# A Good Unconditioned Stimulus
- To be effective, the unconditioned stimulus should evoke a strong bodily response
	- E.g., pain, drugs, loud noise
- The more intense the unconditioned stimulus, the easier to produce a conditioned response
	- Though there is a limit
