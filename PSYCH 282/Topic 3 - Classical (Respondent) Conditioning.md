# Unconditioned Stimuli and Responses
![[Pasted image 20250121162244.png]]
# The Unconditioned Stimulus
- Can be classified as:
	- Appetitive: a stimulus the animal finds pleasant
		- E.g., food, play, etc.
	- Aversive: a stimulus the animal finds unpleasant
		- E.g., loud sound, darkness, etc.
# A Good Unconditioned Stimulus
- To be effective, the unconditioned stimulus should evoke a strong bodily response
	- E.g., pain, drugs, loud noise
- The more intense the unconditioned stimulus, the easier to produce a conditioned response
	- Though there is a limit

## Temporal  Relationship
### Short-Delay Conditioning
- CS presentation alone, but US overlaps shortly after onset
- Usually most effective conditioning procedure
![[Pasted image 20250123160101.png]]
### Long-Delay Conditioning
- CS and US overlap, but CS is on for longer time  
- CS becomes an imprecise predictor of US
![[Pasted image 20250123160131.png]]
### Trace Conditioning
- No overlap between CS and US  
- Temporal Contiguity matters
	- NOT continuity
	- How close they are in time
![[Pasted image 20250123160207.png]]

### Simultaneous Conditioning
- CS and US onset is at the same time  
- Less common in the real world  
- Less effective than Delayed and Trace conditioning
![[Pasted image 20250123160332.png]]
### Backward Conditioning
- US occurs before CS
- Results are inconsistent
![[Pasted image 20250123160400.png]]
## Temporal Relationship
- Can also apply to time between pairings  
	- E.g., how long between one NS+US exposure and the next NS+US exposure?  
- Intertrial-Interval  
	- Interval between one CS-US exposure (a trial) and another CS-US exposure (a different trial)  
	- Can vary from seconds to years  
	- In general, longer intervals are better than short intervals
## Contingency between NS and US
- Contingency between the NS and the US means that the NS and US co-occur reliably  
	- NS doesn’t happen without the US following it  
	- US doesn’t happen without the NS having first occurred  
- Contiguity: Events are close together in time and space
- e.g., Rescorla (1968)  
	- CS = Tone  
	- US = Shock  
	- CR = Suppression of lever pressing for food  
		- Lower ratio = more freezing (i.e., less lever pressing)  
- When US was as likely to occur in the presence of the CS as its absence conditioning was not effective
![[Pasted image 20250123162004.png]]
- ignore everything other than the first column
## Number of Pairings
- More pairings of the NS and US usually forms a stronger association  
- Though first pairing produces the strongest learning effect

# Conditioned Taste Aversion (CTA)
- Taste aversions (and preferences) are learned  
- Eat a (novel) food → aversive consequence  
- e.g., indigestion or food poisoning  
- Can occur with just one pairing (single trial)  
- Can occur even if illness occurs hours later
![[Pasted image 20250123164038.png]]
# Previous Experience
- **Latent Inhibition:**  
	- Pre-exposure of a stimulus in the absence of a US interferes with the ability of that stimulus to become a CS  
- **Blocking:**  
	- Failure of a stimulus to become a CS when it is part of a compound stimulus that includes an already effective CS
- **Sensory Preconditioning:**  
	1) Two neutral stimuli (A & B) occur together  
	2) One of those stimuli (B) is conditioned to become a CS  
	3) When A is presented alone, it too will elicit the same CR as B
