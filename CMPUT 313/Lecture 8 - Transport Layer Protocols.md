# Transport services and protocols
- Provide logical communication between application processes on different hosts
- Transport protocol actions
	- sender breaks app message into **segments**, passes to network layer
	- receiver reassembles segments into messages, passes to application layer
- TCP and UDP are protocols in this layer
# Transport vs. network layer services and protocols
- Transport layer
	- communication between processes on the same or different hosts
	- many processes run on each host
	- relies on and enhances network layer services
- Network layer
	- communication between hosts
