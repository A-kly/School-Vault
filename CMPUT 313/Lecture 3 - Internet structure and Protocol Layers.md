# Canonical approaches to sharing network resources
## Sharing network resources
- network has many simultaneous flows
	- Shared resources can be bottlenecked
	- sizing shared resources (links, routers) to reduce congestion is an important thing to worry about
- **Observation:** peak average demand from N hosts, is typically much less than the sum of the peak demand of these hosts 
	- Peak demands for each host happens at different times
	- shared resources are statistically multiplexeds
