# Intro to computer networks
## what is a computer network
- Form of communication network
- **nodes:** devices
- network carries **packets** (chunks of data)
- **Links:** connections between devices
	- point to point connections (one wire connecting each computer to another computer)
	- Multiple access connections (Data that is sent can be seen by any other computer connected to the same line)
## Scaling more nodes
- Switches/routers connect multiple networks and forward packets
	- Can scale to be more and more nodes
	- These, all connected are called an **Access Network**
	- **Edge routers** connect between *access networks*
## Protocols
- Defines syntax and semantics of messages sent over a network
	- Format, order, actions taken 
	- TCP is an example of this
	- Data transfer between distributed entities in a network is governed by protocols

## What is the internet?
- Connects existing netowrks that use different internet technologies
- Nowadays connects over 100,000 independent networks
	- Each netowrk often represents administrative boundaries with competing intrests, so the internet is a federated system
	- no internal changes required to connect to internet
	- interoperability is biggest goal
### Nuts and bolts
- Billions of computing devices
	- end hosts, nodes, systems
	- running network apps at internet's edge
- Packet switches
	- Forwards packets, routers, switches
- Communication links
	- Fiber, copper, radio, satellite
- Networks
	- Collections of devices, routers and links, managed by organization
- Internet
	- Netowork of networks
- Protocols
	- control sending and receiving of messages
- Internet standsards
	- Developed by internet engineering task force (IETF) called Request for Comments (RFC)
	- nearly 9,000 RFCs

- infrastructure that provides services to applications
- provides programming interfaces
	- “hooks” allowing sending/receiving apps to “connect” to, use Internet transport service
## Scale and diversity
- 5B+ users
- 1.24 Trillion devices
- lots of diversity in tech and, devices, applications and services
- Design goals
	- Accommodate variety of networks
	- support multiple types of communications service
	- permit distributed management of it's resources
