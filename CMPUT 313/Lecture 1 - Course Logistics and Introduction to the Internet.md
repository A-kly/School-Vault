# Intro to computer networks
## what is a computer network
- Form of communication network
- **nodes:** devices
- network carries **packets** (chunks of data)
- **Links:** connections between devices
	- point to point connections (one wire connecting each computer to another computer)
	- Multiple access connections (Data that is sent can be seen by any other computer connected to the same line)
## Scaling more nodes
- Switches/routers connect multiple networks and forward packets
	- Can scale to be more and more nodes
	- These, all connected are called an **Access Network**
	- **Edge routers** connect between *access networks*
## Protocols
- Defines syntax and semantics of messages sent over a network
	- Format, order,
