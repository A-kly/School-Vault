# Why is realiability important?
- Many apps need it
- Design goals
	- Correctness
		- Every packet is received at least once
	- Timeliness
		- each packet is delivered asap!
	- efficiency
		- maximize throughput and avoid wasting bandwidth for unecessary retransmission

- How it started -> how its going
## Challenge: Building a reliable service on top of unreliable network

## Reliable data transfer protocol (rdt): interfaces
![[Pasted image 20250204111206.png]]
# Reliable data transfer: getting started
- Do sender and receiver repeatedly to implement reliable data transfer protocol (rdt)
- consider only unidirectional data transfer
	- but control info will flow in both directions!
- use finite state machines (FSM) to specify sender and receiver

## rdt1.0: reliable transfer over a reliable channel
- Underlying channel perfectly reliable
	- no bit errors
	- no loss of packets
- Separate FSMs for sender and receiver:
	- sender sends data into underlying channel
	- receiver reads data from underlying channel

## rdt2.0 has a fatal flaw!
- What happens if ACK/NAK gets corrupted?
	- corruption of ACK/NAK can be detected using a checksum too
	- sender does not know what happened at receiver and canâ€™t just retransmit (possible duplicate)
- How to handle duplicates?
	- sender retransmits current packet if ACK/NAK is corrupted
	- sender adds sequence number to each packet
	- receiver discards duplicate packet

- This last example wastes bandwidth but cane be mitigated with longer timer

### Go-Back-N: sender
- sender: window of up to N, consecutive transmitted but unACKed packets, where N is sender window size (SWS)
	- assign sequence number to each packet: k-bit seq # in packet header
	- ![[Pasted image 20250204115430.png]]
- cumulative ACK: ACK(n): ACKs all packets up to, including seq # n
	- on receiving ACK(n): move window forward to begin at n+1
	- avoids unnecessary retransmision if ACK of a received packet is lost
- timer for oldest in-flight packet
- timeout(n): retransmit packet n and all higher seq number packets in window
