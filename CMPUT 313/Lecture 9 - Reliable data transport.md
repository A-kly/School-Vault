# Why is realiability important?
- Many apps need it
- Design goals
	- Correctness
		- Every packet is received at least once
	- Timeliness
		- each packet is delivered asap!
	- efficiency
		- maximize throughput and avoid wasting bandwidth for unecessary retransmission

- How it started -> how its going
## Challenge: Building a reliable service on top of unreliable network

## Reliable data transfer protocol (rdt): interfaces
![[Pasted image 20250204111206.png]]
# Reliable data transfer: getting started
- Do sender and receiver repeatedly to implement reliable data transfer protocol (rdt)
- consider only unidirectional data transfer
	- but control info will flow in both directions!
- use finite state machines (FSM) to specify sender and receiver
![[Pasted image 20250204111525.png]]
## rdt1.0: reliable transfer over a reliable channel
- Underlying channel perfectly reliable
	- no bit errors
	- no loss of packets
- Separate FSMs for sender and receiver:
	- sender sends data into underlying channel
	- receiver reads data from underlying channel

## rdt2.0 has a fatal flaw!
- What happens if ACK/NAK gets corrupted?
	- corruption of ACK/NAK can be detected using a checksum too
	- sender does not know what happened at receiver and can’t just retransmit (possible duplicate)
- How to handle duplicates?
	- sender retransmits current packet if ACK/NAK is corrupted
	- sender adds sequence number to each packet
	- receiver discards duplicate packet

- This last example wastes bandwidth but cane be mitigated with longer timer

# rdt3.0: pipelined protocols operation

## Pipelining: increased utilization

## GBN
### Go-Back-N: sender
- sender: window of up to N, consecutive transmitted but unACKed packets, where N is sender window size (SWS)
	- assign sequence number to each packet: k-bit seq # in packet header
	- ![[Pasted image 20250204115430.png]]
- cumulative ACK: ACK(n): ACKs all packets up to, including seq # n
	- on receiving ACK(n): move window forward to begin at n+1
	- avoids unnecessary retransmision if ACK of a received packet is lost
- timer for oldest in-flight packet
- timeout(n): retransmit packet n and all higher seq number packets in window

### Go-Back-N: receiver

### Go-Back-N in action
![[Pasted image 20250204120104.png]]
## Selective repeat
- multiple packets are in flight due to pipelining
	- receiver individually ACKs all correctly received packets
		-  buffers packets, as needed, for in-order delivery to upper layer
		-  receiver window size (RWS) > 1
- sender:
	-  maintains (conceptually) a timer for each unACKed packet
		-  timeout: retransmits single unACKed packet associated with timeout
	-  maintains (conceptually) window over N consecutive sequence numbers
		-  limits pipelined, “in flight” packets to be within this window
### Selective Repeat: sender, receiver windows

### Selective Repeat in action
![[Pasted image 20250204120535.png]]
### Selective repeat: a dilemma!
- example:
	- seq. numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3 (base 4 counting)
	- window size=3
![[Pasted image 20250204120958.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20250204121059.png|400]]
- What relationship is needed between sequence number size and sender/receiver window size to avoid problem in scenario (b)?
### Early detection of packet loss
- Begin retransmission before timeout to reduce delay
	- individual ACK
		- k (=3) subsequent ACKs arriving could imply a packet loss (e.g. receiving ACK of packet n+1, n+2, and n+3 but not ACK of packet n)
	- cumulative ACK
		- k (=3) duplicate ACKs arriving could imply a packet loss (e.g. receiving ACK of packet n-1 three times)
