# Why is realiability important?
- Many apps need it
- Design goals
	- Correctness
		- Every packet is received at least once
	- Timeliness
		- each packet is delivered asap!
	- efficiency
		- maximize throughput and avoid wasting bandwidth for unecessary retransmission

- How it started -> how its going
## Challenge: Building a reliable service on top of unreliable network

## Reliable data transfer protocol (rdt): interfaces
![[Pasted image 20250204111206.png]]
# Reliable data transfer: getting started
- Do sender and receiver repeatedly to implement reliable data transfer protocol (rdt)
- consider only unidirectional data transfer
	- but control info will flow in both directions!
- use finite state machines (FSM) to specify sender and receiver

## rdt1.0: reliable transfer over a reliable channel
- Underlying channel perfectly reliable
	- no bit errors
	- no loss of packets
- Separate FSMs for sender and receiver:
	- sender sends data into underlying channel
	- receiver reads data from underlying channel

### rdt2.0 has a fatal flaw!
- What happens if ACK/NAK gets corrupted?
	- corruption of ACK/NAK can be detected using a checksum too
	- sender does not know what happened at receiver and canâ€™t just retransmit (possible duplicate)
- How to handle duplicates?
	- sender retransmits current packet if ACK/NAK is corrupted
	- sender adds sequence number to each packet
	- receiver discards duplicate packet
