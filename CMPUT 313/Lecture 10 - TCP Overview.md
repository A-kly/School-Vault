# Technoques for reliability
- Checksums
	- one bit errors
- Acks, timeout, retransmission
	- dealing with packet loss
- Sequence number
	- detecting duplicates and reordering
# End-to-end principle
- Where do we implement reliability?
	- link-by-link
		- Cannot be perfectly reliable, caused by failures and bugs
	- so end-to-end checks are needed anyways
	- end-to-end reliability
		- Ensures end points are in correct state

## Ensuring link-by-link reliability
- Unnecessary
- adds complexity
- can improve performance sometimes tho
	- Reducing per-link drop rate
# TCP: overview
- Point-to-point
	- one sender and one receiver
- Reliable, in order byte stream
- full-duplex service
	- Bidirectional data flow
	- packets carry data AND Ack info
- Cumulative Ack
- pipelining
	- congestion and flow control change window size
- Single retransmission timer
- Flow controlled
- connection-oriented
	- handshaking (control messages) initializes sender and receiver state variables
## What is a byte stream
- Sequence of bytes
![[Pasted image 20250206112114.png]]
- Application writes some bytes to socket buffer
- TCP protocol grabs these bytes, once we reach enough of them, it sends them over the network
- Other machine removes header and reconstructs the byte stream from these packets
- **For every socket, we have a send buffer and a receive buffer**
	- Buffer size can change during runtime
## When is a TCP segment sent?

## MSS vs MTU
- **Maximum segment size (MSS)**: maximum size of payload in TCP segments (i.e. application-layer data)
	- negotiated during connection setup
- **Maximum transmission unit (MTU)**: maximum size of link-layer frames, including transport and IP headers
	- for TCP segments: MSS = MTU - IP header - TCP header
	- MTU depends on network technology
	- Ethernet and PPP link-layer protocols have an MTU of 1,500 Bytes
- Typical size of TCP/IP headers is 40 Bytes in total, so a typical value of MSS is 1460 bytes
## TCP segment structure
![[Pasted image 20250206113113.png]]
- Don't need to memorize
- look online lol
- RST
	- Reset
- SYN
	- Synchronize
- FIN
	- For tearing down connection
