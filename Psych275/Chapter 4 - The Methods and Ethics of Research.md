# Theory and Tentativeness in Science
- **Theory:** integrates and interprets diverse observations in an attempt to explain a phenomenon
- Science uses tentative language
	- Studies may be flawed
	- New data may change interpretation of old studies
	- Laws of probability suggest results could be random
# Experimental Vs Correlational Studies
- Observation has a broad definition in science
	- Naturalistic observations
	- Case studies
	- Surveys
	- Experiments
- **Experimental study:** researcher manipulates independent variable to produce change in the dependent variable
	- Experimenter attempts to eliminate extraneous variables
	- Experimenters sacrifice realism for control
- Correlational study: researcher observes whether two variables are related
	- Cannot determine cause and effect.
	- Chance of confounding variables
	- Results are valuable, but require careful interpretation

# Research Techniques
## Staining and Imaging Neurons (On exam, multiple choice question)
### Structure staining
- **Golgi stain:** randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide
	- Really pretty, stains entire neuron, shows us general neuron shape
- **Myelin stain:** taken up by the fatty myelin surrounding axons
	- shows us the axons, good at visualizing the neural pathways + connections
- **Nissl stain:** identifies cell bodies of neurons
	- Where and how many are the cell bodies?
- **Retrograde stains:** taken up by neuron terminals and transported up the axons to cell bodies
	- Injected into brain of animal while alive, gets taken up by axon terminals of one cell and sucks it backwards to dendrites.
	- Lets us see what parts of brain send info to the part we injected

> a) Golgi stain
> b) Mylelin stain
> c) Nissl stain
### Activity staining
- **Autoradiography:** stains and reveals which neurons are active
	- Basically a post death PET scan, give organism radioactive tagged glucose, organism does task, this causes more active cells to absorb more glucose, take organism out back, do scan, brain parts that used radioactive glucose light up
- **Immunocytochemistry:** uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components
	- Like fMRI, doesn't use radioactive tagging.
	- Cells make proteins when they become active, kill animal, we send dyed antibodies into brain, antibodies latch onto proteins and dye those cells. Locates where brain was active and also exactly how many cells were active in that area (compare brain reaction strength to stimulus.)
- **In situ hybridization:** construction of DNA strands which complement an mRNA strand
	- Like *Immunocytochemistry* but instead of targeting proteins, we target mRNA
	- **Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA):** copy of one DNA strand carried from cell nucleus into cytoplasm

## Light and Electron Microscopy
- **Light microscopy** can only magnify 1500x
- **Electron microscope** magnify up to 250,000x
- **Transmission electron microscope:** passes beam of electrons through thin slice of tissue
	- Magnifies images up to 50 million times
	- ![[Pasted image 20240206093828.png|300]]
- **Scanning electron microscope:** beam of electrons induces specimen to emit electrons
	- Enhancement of transmission electron technique
	- Magnifies images up to 2–3 million times
	- Produces 3-D image
	- Confocal laser scanning microscope and two-photon microscope
## Measuring & Manipulating Brain Activity
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** electronic amplifier detects electrical activity of all neurons between two electrodes
	- **Temporal resolution:** events as close as 1 ms apart
	- **Spatial resolution:** imprecise unless electrodes are applied directly to the brain surface
	- **Event-related potential:** averaging many recorded responses to stimulus
		- Cancels out background noise
		- Reveals brain’s unique response to stimulus

> Example of EEG

> Top = average person
> Middle = Mildly conscious people
> Bottom = people in coma

- **Stereotaxic instrument:** device allowing precise positioning of a probe in the brain
	- Probes typically fine-wire electrodes
	- Microelectrodes can monitor and stimulate a single neuron
	- *big cage to keep head in one position, for animals used for lesions and direct drug administration*
- **Optogenetic techniques:** light-sensitive channels can be inserted in specific types of neurons
	- More precise than electrical stimulation
	- *take cells from algae or bacteria that open and close their ion channels dependent on light, insert these genes into animal neurons, activate certain parts of brain due to light*
	- *more precise*
- **Chemical stimulation via cannulation**
	- *change chemical makeup around neurons*
	- *canulation = tiny tube inserted into brain, drugs inserted into it*
	- **Microdialysis:** a more complex variation of cannulation
- **Natural experiments:** historically, brain damaged patients were a rich source of brain research
	- Damage may overlap different functional areas
	- Damage may fail to affect the entirety of a functional area
- **Ablation:** surgical removal of brain tissue
	- Used for large areas - imprecise
	- Often done by aspiration
- **Lesioning:** surgical damaging of neural tissue
	- *often done by injecting acid or a drug (that may wear off over time)*
	- Precise and sometimes reversible
- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):** noninvasive technique using a magnet coil to induce a voltage
	- Device held over scalp and pulsed at varying rates
	- Valuable in both research and therapeutically
	- Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
		- *uses electricity instead of magnet*
		- *targets astrocites instead of neurons*
## Brain Imaging Techniques
- **Computed tomography (CT):** produces series of X-rays, then composites them into a 3-D image
	- “False colors” added for contrast
	- Image shows differing densities of blood vessels in the brain
![[Pasted image 20240206094439.png]]
> c) shows a tumor
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):** measures radio-frequency waves emitted by hydrogen atoms exposed to magnetic field
	- Most hydrogen atoms within water molecules
	- Non-hydrogen elements can now be measured
	- Diffusion tensor imaging: MRI variant measuring the movement of water molecules
![[Pasted image 20240206100323.png]]
- **Positron emission tomography (PET):** observation of brain regions through a radioactive substance injected into bloodstream
	- Scanner picks up emitted positrons to form a color-coded image
	- Indicates relative activity of brain regions
	- Difference scans
	- Cannot detect changes less than 30 s in duration
	- Results do not image the brain
![[Pasted image 20240206100542.png|500]]
- **Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI):** detects increases in blood flow and oxygen usage
	- Suitable for repeated measurements
	- Good spatial resolution
	- Alternative to PET scans
	- Costly due to expense of equipment

- Brain imaging is the main experimental technique in neuroscience
- Limitations of brain imaging:
	- fMRI in particular is low sensitivity
	- Test-retest reliability often low
	- Methods of data selection (“data snooping”)
# Investigating Heredity
## Genetic Similarities: The Correlational Approach
- **Family study:** determines how a characteristic is shared among relatives
- Heredity’s effects typically confounded by environment
- Variables measured on a numerical scale require a correlation coefficient
- **Correlation:** degree of relationship between two variables
	- Expressed with correlation coefficient, a number between 0.0 and ±1.0
	- Positive correlations: both variables are high
	- Negative correlations: when one variable is high, the other is low
- **Twin study:** assessing how similar twins are compared to each other and nontwin or fraternal twin siblings
- **Concordance rate:** frequency with which relatives are alike in a characteristic
![[Pasted image 20240208100657.png]]
## Genetic Engineering: The Experimental Approach
- **Genetic engineering:** manipulating an organism’s genes
- **Knockout technique:** nonfunctioning mutation introduced into gene, then transferred to embryos
- **Knockdown technique:** silencing a gene by interfering with its expression
	- **Antisense RNA:** complementary strand of RNA which binds to mRNA to block gene expression
