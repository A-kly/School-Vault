# Theory and Tentativeness in Science
- **Theory:** integrates and interprets diverse observations in an attempt to explain a phenomenon
- Science uses tentative language
	- Studies may be flawed
	- New data may change interpretation of old studies
	- Laws of probability suggest results could be random
# Experimental Vs Correlational Studies
- Observation has a broad definition in science
	- Naturalistic observations
	- Case studies
	- Surveys
	- Experiments
- **Experimental study:** researcher manipulates independent variable to produce change in the dependent variable
	- Experimenter attempts to eliminate extraneous variables
	- Experimenters sacrifice realism for control
- Correlational study: researcher observes whether two variables are related
	- Cannot determine cause and effect.
	- Chance of confounding variables
	- Results are valuable, but require careful interpretation

# Research Techniques
## Staining and Imaging Neurons
- **Golgi stain:** randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide
- **Myelin stain:** taken up by the fatty myelin surrounding axons
- **Nissl stain:** identifies cell bodies of neurons
- **Retrograde stains:** taken up by neuron terminals and transported up the axons to cell bodies

- **Autoradiography:** stains and reveals which neurons are active
- **Immunocytochemistry:** uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components
- **In situ hybridization:** construction of DNA strands which complement an mRNA strand
- **Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA):** copy of one DNA strand carried from cell nucleus into cytoplasm

## Light and Electron Microscopy
- **Light microscopy** can only magnify 1500x
- **Electron microscope** magnify up to 250,000x
- **Transmission electron microscope:** passes beam of electrons through thin slice of tissue
	- Magnifies images up to 50 million times
	- ![[Pasted image 20240206093828.png|300]]
- **Scanning electron microscope:** beam of electrons induces specimen to emit electrons
	- Enhancement of transmission electron technique
	- Magnifies images up to 2–3 million times
	- Produces 3-D image
	- Confocal laser scanning microscope and two-photon microscope
## Measuring & Manipulating Brain Activity
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** electronic amplifier detects electrical activity of all neurons between two electrodes
- **Temporal resolution:** events as close as 1 ms apart
- **Spatial resolution:** imprecise unless electrodes are applied directly to the brain surface
- **Event-related potential:** averaging many recorded responses to stimulus
	- Cancels out background noise
	- Reveals brain’s unique response to stimulus
