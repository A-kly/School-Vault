# Theory and Tentativeness in Science
- **Theory:** integrates and interprets diverse observations in an attempt to explain a phenomenon
- Science uses tentative language
	- Studies may be flawed
	- New data may change interpretation of old studies
	- Laws of probability suggest results could be random
# Experimental Vs Correlational Studies
- Observation has a broad definition in science
	- Naturalistic observations
	- Case studies
	- Surveys
	- Experiments
- **Experimental study:** researcher manipulates independent variable to produce change in the dependent variable
	- Experimenter attempts to eliminate extraneous variables
	- Experimenters sacrifice realism for control
- Correlational study: researcher observes whether two variables are related
	- Cannot determine cause and effect.
	- Chance of confounding variables
	- Results are valuable, but require careful interpretation
