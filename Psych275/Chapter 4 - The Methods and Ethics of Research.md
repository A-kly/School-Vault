# Theory and Tentativeness in Science
- **Theory:** integrates and interprets diverse observations in an attempt to explain a phenomenon
- Science uses tentative language
	- Studies may be flawed
	- New data may change interpretation of old studies
	- Laws of probability suggest results could be random
# Experimental Vs Correlational Studies
- Observation has a broad definition in science
	- Naturalistic observations
	- Case studies
	- Surveys
	- Experiments
- **Experimental study:** researcher manipulates independent variable to produce change in the dependent variable
	- Experimenter attempts to eliminate extraneous variables
	- Experimenters sacrifice realism for control
- Correlational study: researcher observes whether two variables are related
	- Cannot determine cause and effect.
	- Chance of confounding variables
	- Results are valuable, but require careful interpretation

# Research Techniques
## Staining and Imaging Neurons (On exam, multiple choice question)
### Structure staining
- **Golgi stain:** randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide
	- Really pretty, stains entire neuron, shows us general neuron shape
- **Myelin stain:** taken up by the fatty myelin surrounding axons
	- shows us the axons, good at visualizing the neural pathways + connections
- **Nissl stain:** identifies cell bodies of neurons
	- Where and how many are the cell bodies?
- **Retrograde stains:** taken up by neuron terminals and transported up the axons to cell bodies
	- Injected into brain of animal while alive, gets taken up by axon terminals of one cell and sucks it backwards to dendrites.
	- Lets us see what parts of brain send info to the part we injected

### Activity staining
- **Autoradiography:** stains and reveals which neurons are active
	- Basically a post death PET scan, give organism radioactive tagged glucose, organism does task, this causes more active cells to absorb more glucose, take organism out back, do scan, brain parts that used radioactive glucose light up
- **Immunocytochemistry:** uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components
	- Like fMRI, doesn't use radioactive tagging.
	- Cells make proteins when they become active, kill animal, we send dyed antibodies into brain, antibodies latch onto proteins and dye those cells. Locates where brain was active and also exactly how many cells were active in that area (compare brain reaction strength to stimulus.)
- **In situ hybridization:** construction of DNA strands which complement an mRNA strand
	- Like *Immunocytochemistry* but instead of targeting proteins, we target mRNA
	- **Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA):** copy of one DNA strand carried from cell nucleus into cytoplasm

## Light and Electron Microscopy
- **Light microscopy** can only magnify 1500x
- **Electron microscope** magnify up to 250,000x
- **Transmission electron microscope:** passes beam of electrons through thin slice of tissue
	- Magnifies images up to 50 million times
	- ![[Pasted image 20240206093828.png|300]]
- **Scanning electron microscope:** beam of electrons induces specimen to emit electrons
	- Enhancement of transmission electron technique
	- Magnifies images up to 2–3 million times
	- Produces 3-D image
	- Confocal laser scanning microscope and two-photon microscope
## Measuring & Manipulating Brain Activity
- **Electroencephalogram (EEG):** electronic amplifier detects electrical activity of all neurons between two electrodes
- **Temporal resolution:** events as close as 1 ms apart
- **Spatial resolution:** imprecise unless electrodes are applied directly to the brain surface
- **Event-related potential:** averaging many recorded responses to stimulus
	- Cancels out background noise
	- Reveals brain’s unique response to stimulus

- **Stereotaxic instrument:** device allowing precise positioning of a probe in the brain
	- Probes typically fine-wire electrodes
	- Microelectrodes can monitor and stimulate a single neuron
- **Optogenetic techniques:** light-sensitive channels can be inserted in specific types of neurons
	- More precise than electrical stimulation
- Chemical stimulation via cannulation
	- **Microdialysis:** a more complex variation of cannulation
- **Natural experiments:** historically, brain damaged patients were a rich source of brain research
	- Damage may overlap different functional areas
	- Damage may fail to affect the entirety of a functional area
- **Ablation:** surgical removal of brain tissue
	- Used for large areas - imprecise
	- Often done by aspiration
- **Lesioning:** surgical damaging of neural tissue
	- Precise and sometimes reversible
- **Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):** noninvasive technique using a magnet coil to induce a voltage
	- Device held over scalp and pulsed at varying rates
	- Valuable in both research and therapeutically
	- Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
## Brain Imaging Techniques
- **Computed tomography (CT):** produces series of X-rays, then composites them into a 3-D image
	- “False colors” added for contrast
	- Image shows differing densities of blood vessels in the brain
