#AOSR/25hch
Cortex
? #AOSR/25hch/m/1f2i
outer surface of brain; literally, “bark” 
- more surface area because of more gyri and sulci = more cortex = more high level thinking
#/Q

  #AOSR/n2c6i
Precentral gyrus :: (Motor cortex), Frontal lobe #AOSR/n2c6i/s/24j8
***
Broca's area :: Speech formation, *Only on left hemisphere of frontal lobe* #AOSR/n2c6i/s/4jr2

Postcentral gyrus:: (somatosensory cortex), Parietal lobe #AOSR/n2c6i/s/7aro
***
Association areas exist in the =Parietal lobe= and the =Temporal Lobes= #multiclause

Temporal lobes:: Regions containing the *auditory projection area*, *visual and auditory association areas*, an *additional language area*, and *structures important in learning and memory* #AOSR/n2c6i/s/7m39
***
Inferior temporal cortex:: plays major role in visual identification of objects, *In temporal lobe* #AOSR/n2c6i/s/2mae
