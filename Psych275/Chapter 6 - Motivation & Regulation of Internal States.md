# Motivation and Homeostasis
- **Motivation:** set of factors that initiate, sustain, and direct behaviors
	- Behavior unable to be explained solely in terms of outside stimuli
- **Instinct:** complex behavior that is automatic, unlearned, and unmodifiable, occurring in all members of a species
	- Migration and parental behavior in animals
- **Drive theory:** body maintains a condition of homeostasis
	- *Homeostasis:* the state in which any particular system is in balance or equilibrium
	- *Drive:* an aroused condition
## Incentive and Arousal Theory
- **Incentive theory:** people motivated by external stimuli, not just internal needs
- **Arousal theory:** people behave in ways that keep them at preferred level of stimulation
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Temp
- **Set point:** point of homeostasis (or equilibrium) to which the system returns
- **Temperature regulation**:
	- Ectothermic animals (snakes and lizards)
	- Endothermic animals (birds and mammals)
	- *Preoptic area:* brain area in mammalian hypothalamus that contains separate warmth- sensitive and cold-sensitive cells
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Thirst
- Thirst: dry mouth and throat influence when to drink, not how much to drink
	- Hypovolemic thirst: condition of thirst occurring when blood volume drops due to loss of extracellular water
	- Osmotic thirst: condition of thirst occurring when fluid content decreases inside bodyâ€™s cells
