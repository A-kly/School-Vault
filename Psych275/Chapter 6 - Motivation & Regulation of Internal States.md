# Motivation and Homeostasis
- **Motivation:** set of factors that initiate, sustain, and direct behaviors
	- Behavior unable to be explained solely in terms of outside stimuli
- **Instinct:** complex behavior that is automatic, unlearned, and unmodifiable, occurring in all members of a species
	- Migration and parental behavior in animals

- **Drive theory:** body maintains a condition of homeostasis ==(theory to replace instinct theory)==
	- *Homeostasis:* the state in which any particular system is in balance or equilibrium
	- *Drive:* an aroused condition
## Incentive and Arousal Theory
- **Incentive theory:** people motivated by external stimuli, not just internal needs
- **Arousal theory:** people behave in ways that keep them at preferred level of stimulation
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Temp
- **Set point:** point of homeostasis (or equilibrium) to which the system returns
- **Temperature regulation**:
	- Ectothermic animals (snakes and lizards)
	- Endothermic animals (birds and mammals)
	- *Preoptic area:* brain area in mammalian hypothalamus that contains separate warmth- sensitive and cold-sensitive cells
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Thirst
- **Thirst:** dry mouth and throat influence when to drink, not how much to drink
	- **Hypovolemic thirst:** condition of thirst occurring when blood volume drops due to loss of extracellular water
	- **Osmotic thirst:** condition of thirst occurring when fluid content decreases inside body’s cells
- **Subfornical organ (SFO):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that senses and regulates internal water balance with OVLT
- **Organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that senses and regulates internal water balance with SFO
- Both SFO and OVLT are circumventricular organs
	- *Circumventricular:* outside blood-brain barrier with direct access to blood circulation
- Some SFO and OVLT neurons are osmoreceptors
	- *Osmoreceptor:* fires more as volume decreases due to fluid loss
- **Median preoptic nucleus (MnPO):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that integrates information from SFO and OVLT
	- Hypovolemic thirst often signaled by baroreceptors in arteries of heart
- **Angiotensin II:** hormone that informs brain of drop in blood volume, stimulating receptors in SFO and OVLT
- Takes 10–20 minutes for body to realize deficit has been eliminated and stop sending stimulatory signals
- **Satiety:** the satisfaction of appetite

## Hunger: A Complex Drive
### Gustation: The Role of Taste
- Food selection varies widely in animal kingdom:
	- **Herbivores:** plant-eating animals
	- **Carnivores:** meat-eating animals
	- **Omnivores:** animals that eat both meat and plants
- Taste primaries: sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and umami
