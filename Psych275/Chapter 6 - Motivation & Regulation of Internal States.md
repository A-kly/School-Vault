# Motivation and Homeostasis
- **Motivation:** set of factors that initiate, sustain, and direct behaviors
	- Behavior unable to be explained solely in terms of outside stimuli
- **Instinct:** complex behavior that is automatic, unlearned, and unmodifiable, occurring in all members of a species
	- Migration and parental behavior in animals

- **Drive theory:** body maintains a condition of homeostasis ==(theory to replace instinct theory)==
	- *Homeostasis:* the state in which any particular system is in balance or equilibrium
	- *Drive:* an aroused condition
## Incentive and Arousal Theory
- **Incentive theory:** people motivated by external stimuli, not just internal needs
- **Arousal theory:** people behave in ways that keep them at preferred level of stimulation
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Temp
- **Set point:** point of homeostasis (or equilibrium) to which the system returns
- **Temperature regulation**:
	- Ectothermic animals (snakes and lizards)
	- Endothermic animals (birds and mammals)
	- *Preoptic area:* brain area in mammalian hypothalamus that contains separate warmth- sensitive and cold-sensitive cells
## Simple Homeostatic Drives: Thirst
- **Thirst:** dry mouth and throat influence when to drink, not how much to drink
	- **Hypovolemic thirst:** condition of thirst occurring when blood volume drops due to loss of extracellular water
	- **Osmotic thirst:** condition of thirst occurring when fluid content decreases inside body’s cells
- **Subfornical organ (SFO):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that senses and regulates internal water balance with OVLT
- **Organum vasculosum lamina terminalis (OVLT):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that senses and regulates internal water balance with SFO
- Both SFO and OVLT are circumventricular organs
	- *Circumventricular:* outside blood-brain barrier with direct access to blood circulation
- Some SFO and OVLT neurons are osmoreceptors
	- *Osmoreceptor:* fires more as volume decreases due to fluid loss
- **Median preoptic nucleus (MnPO):** brain structure adjacent to third ventricle that integrates information from SFO and OVLT
	- Hypovolemic thirst often signaled by baroreceptors in arteries of heart
- **Angiotensin II:** hormone that informs brain of drop in blood volume, stimulating receptors in SFO and OVLT
- Takes 10–20 minutes for body to realize deficit has been eliminated and stop sending stimulatory signals
- **Satiety:** the satisfaction of appetite

# Hunger: A Complex Drive
## Gustation: The Role of Taste
- Food selection varies widely in animal kingdom:
	- **Herbivores:** plant-eating animals
	- **Carnivores:** meat-eating animals
	- **Omnivores:** animals that eat both meat and plants
- Taste primaries: sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and umami

## Sensory-Specific Satiety
- **Sensory-specific satiety:** behavioral pattern that means the more an individual eats a particular food item, the less appealing the food becomes
- **Learned taste aversion:** avoidance of foods associated with illness or poor nutrition
- **Learned taste preference:** preference not for a nutrient itself but for the flavor of food containing the nutrient

## The Digestive Process
- **Area postrema:** region in brain outside blood-brain barrier that induces vomiting if activated by toxins
- **Duodenum:** initial 25 cm of the small intestine where most digestion occurs
![[Pasted image 20240227102834.png|300]]
- **Glucose:** a simple sugar which is a common metabolic product of carbohydrate digestion
- **Amino acids:** an end product of protein digestion
- **Fatty acids:** an end product of fat digested in the intestine
- **Glycerol:** an end product of fat digested in the liver

### The Absorptive Phase
- **Absorption phase:** the few hours after a meal when the body lives off the nutrients arriving from the digestive system
- **Insulin:** hormone that enables body cells to take up glucose for energy and certain cells to store excess nutrients
#### Diabetes
- **Diabetes:** condition that results when pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin (Type 1) or the body’s tissues are relatively unresponsive to insulin (Type 2)
- **Glycogen:** converted form of glucose stored in short-term reservoirs around body
### The Fasting Phase
- **Fasting phase:** period in which blood glucose drops and the body falls back on its energy stores
- **Glucagon:** hormone that causes liver and skeletal muscles to transform stored glycogen back into glucose
## Regulating Hunger
- **Paraventricular nucleus (PVN):** brain region that regulates eating and metabolic processes
- **Ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH):** brain region that produces satiety and increases metabolism
- **Ghrelin:** orexigenic peptide hormone synthesized in the stomach and released into bloodstream during fasting
![[Pasted image 20240227103253.png|300]]
- Optimal satiation requires interaction of mouth, stomach, and intestinal factors
- **Cholecystokinin (CCK):** peptide hormone that is best known satiety signal, released by stomach and small intestine as food passes into duodenum
	- Limits meal size and aids digestion
## Long-Term Regulation of Hunger
- **Peptide YY3-36 (PYY):** peptide hormone released in intestines in response to food, suppressing appetite over longer period of time
- **Leptin:** peptide hormone secreted by fat cells that inhibits eating
	- Reduces meal size and total daily intake

## Obesity
- **Body mass index (BMI):** quantifier of leanness or obesity calculated by dividing person’s weight in kilograms by squared height in meters
	- Increased health risks
	- Cannot be characterized by lack of impulse control, inability to delay gratification, or maladaptive eating style
- **Obesity gene:** gene on chromosome 6 linked to obesity in mice, signified as *ob*
- **Diabetes gene:** gene on chromosome 4 linked to obesity in mice, signified as *db*
- **Epigenetic:** modifications to DNA that turn genes “on” or “off” without changing gene’s DNA sequence
	- **Methylation**
### Obesity and Dieting
- **Basal metabolism:** energy required to fuel brain and other organs and to maintain body temperature
- Metabolism will increase or decrease in order to defend a set point weight
- Goal of 10% weight reduction can be more practical than return to normal weight
 10% reduction also associated with reduced risk for chronic disease
