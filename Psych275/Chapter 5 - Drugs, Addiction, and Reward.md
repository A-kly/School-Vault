# Psychoactive Drugs
## Drugs
- **Drug:** medicine or other substance that changes the body’s functioning
	- Agonists
	- Antagonists
- **Psychoactive drugs:** drugs with psychological effects such as anxiety relief or hallucinations
## Effects of Drugs
- **Dependence:** need to keep taking a drug to avoid withdrawal
	- Physical dependence
	- Psychological dependence
- **Tolerance:** more of the drug required to produce same effects
- **Addiction:** *preoccupation* with obtaining a drug, *compulsive use*, and a *tendency to relapse* after quitting
- **Withdrawal:** negative reaction when drug use is stopped

## Opiates and Opioids
- **Opiate**
	- Natural narcotic opioid alkyloids found in the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum)
- **Opioid**
	- Any natural or synthetic compound or the *endogenous peptides* that exert biological effects at the opioid receptors
- **Heroin:** most notoriously abused opiate; synthesized from morphine
- **Endogenous endorphins:** body’s own neurotransmitters for receptors opioid drugs act on
	- **Endogenous:** generated within the body
	- **Endorphins:** endogenous opioids
## Depressants
- **Depressants:** drugs that reduce CNS activity
	- Sedative
	- Anxiolytic
	- Hypnotic
- Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are all types of depressants
- **Delirium tremens:** severe reaction to alcohol withdrawal resulting in hallucinations, delusions, confusion, and in extreme cases seizures and possible death
- **Barbiturates:** drugs that in small amounts act selectively on higher cortical centers, especially those involved in inhibiting behavior
- **Benzodiazepines:** drugs that act at benzodiazepine receptor on the GABAA complex to produce anxiety reduction, sedation, and muscle relaxation

## Stimulants
- **Stimulants:** drugs that activate CNS to produce arousal, increased alertness, and elevated mood
	- Cocaine
	- Amphetamines
	- Nicotine
	- Caffeine
- **Cocaine:** drug extracted from South American coca plant—produces euphoria, decreases appetite, increases alertness, and relieves fatigue
- **Amphetamines:** group of synthetic drugs that produce euphoria and increase confidence and concentration
- **Bath salts:** variety of synthetic drugs related to cathinone, a stimulant found in the khat (Catha edulis) plant
- **Nicotine:** primary psychoactive and addictive agent in tobacco
- **Caffeine:** active ingredient in coffee and tea, which produces arousal, increased alertness, and decreased sleepiness
## Psychedelic Drugs
- **Psychedelic Drugs:** compounds that cause perceptual distortions in the user
	- Serotonergic
		- Act on serotonin receptors, LSD, Magic mushrooms
	- Catecholaminergic
		- Act on dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine,
		- Also stimulants
		- Ecstasy, MDMA
	- NMDA receptor agonists
		- Glutimate (???)
		- ketamine, pcp
	- Designer drugs
		- Very dangerous, made in lab
		- 
## Marijuana
- **Marijuana:** dried and crushed leaves and flowers of the plant Cannabis sativa
- **Cannabinoid:** group of compounds including anandamide and 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG)
- Illegality of marijuana has led to creation of synthetic marijuana, which may be lethal
# Addiction
- Neither pleasurable effects from a drug nor withdrawal fully account for drug use motivation
- **Reward:** positive effect an object or condition has on the user
- **Mesolimbic pathway:** reward circuit
	- Ventral tegmental area
	- Nucleus accumbens

## Synaptic Plasticity and Addiction
- Addiction creates functional and structural changes in the brain that persist long after drug usage stops
- **Mesocorticolimbic dopamine system:** system consisting of ventral tegmental area and the brain regions receiving its dopaminergic projections, including nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus
- **Hypofrontality:** reduced activity in frontal regions that control working memory, behavioral inhibition, and response to environment
- Cravings persist after years of drug abstinence
## Treating Drug Addiction
- **Treatment strategies**:
	- Agonist treatments
	- Methadone
	- Antagonist treatments
	- Aversive treatments
	- Antidrug vaccines
- **Comorbidity:** addiction often appears in combination with mental or emotional personality disorders which can complicate rehabilitation
- **Agonist treatments:** replace addicting drug with another drug with similar effect
- **Methadone:** synthetic opioid used to treat opioid addiction
- **Antagonist treatments:** involve drugs that block effects of the addicting drug
- **Aversive treatments:** cause a negative reaction when person takes the drug
- **Antidrug vaccines:** molecules that attach to the drug and stimulate immune system to make antibodies that will degrade the drug
- **Comorbidity:** addiction often appears in combination with mental or emotional personality disorders which can complicate rehabilitation
# The Role of Genes in Addiction
- Heritability of addiction first established with alcoholism
	- Type 1 alcoholic
	- Type 2 alcoholic
- Genetic influences affect how drugs are metabolized, neurotransmitter/receptor levels, and other addiction risk factors
- Drugs also impact genetic function
	- **Methylation:** attachment of a methyl group to DNA, which suppresses a gene’s activity
- Addiction research sheds light on complex mechanisms of addiction
# In Perspective
- Immense costs of drug abuse:
	- Human suffering
	- Loss of health, productivity, and life
	- Billions spent on treatment and incarceration
- Studying drug abuse gives insight into the brain and biological forces that mold human behavior
