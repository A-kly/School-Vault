#Q #AOSR/4pc5o
Golgi stain  ::  ::   randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide ++Really pretty, stains entire neuron, shows us general neuron shape #AOSR/4pc5o/s/7j4v
***
Myelin stain  ::  ::   taken up by the fatty myelin surrounding axons ++shows us the axons, good at visualizing the neural pathways + connections #AOSR/4pc5o/s/1ja8
***
Nissl stain  ::  ::   identifies cell bodies of neurons ++Where and how many are the cell bodies? #AOSR/4pc5o/s/3kk9
***
Retrograde stains  ::  ::   taken up by neuron terminals and transported up the axons to cell bodies ++Injected into brain of animal while alive, gets taken up by axon terminals of one cell and sucks it backwards to dendrites.++Lets us see what parts of brain send info to the part we injected #AOSR/4pc5o/s/5e0t
***
Autoradiography  ::  ::   stains and reveals which neurons are active ++Basically a post death PET scan, give organism radioactive tagged glucose, organism does task, this causes more active cells to absorb more glucose, take organism out back, do scan, brain parts that used radioactive glucose light up #AOSR/4pc5o/s/4omn
***
Immunocytochemistry  ::  ::   uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components ++Like fMRI, doesn't use radioactive tagging. ++Cells make proteins when they become active, kill animal, we send dyed antibodies into brain, antibodies latch onto proteins and dye those cells. Locates where brain was active and also exactly how many cells were active in that area (compare brain reaction strength to stimulus.) #AOSR/4pc5o/s/48et
***
In situ hybridization  ::  ::   construction of DNA strands which complement an mRNA strand ++Like ***Immunocytochemistry*** but instead of targeting proteins, we target mRNA #AOSR/4pc5o/s/4p4h
*** 
Transmission electron microscope  ::  ::   passes beam of electrons through thin slice of tissue ++Magnifies images up to 50 million times #AOSR/4pc5o/s/77mj
***
Scanning electron microscope  ::  ::   beam of electrons induces specimen to emit electrons++Enhancement of transmission electron technique++Magnifies images up to 2â€“3 million times++Produces 3-D image++Confocal laser scanning microscope and two-photon microscope #AOSR/4pc5o/s/97r9
***
Electroencephalogram (EEG)  ::  ::  electronic amplifier detects electrical activity of all neurons between two electrodes ++ Temporal resolution ::  events as close as 1 ms apart ++ Spatial resolution ::  imprecise unless electrodes are applied directly to the brain surface ++ Event-related potential ::  averaging many recorded responses to stimulus #AOSR/4pc5o/s/6r7l
***
Stereotaxic instrument ::  device allowing precise positioning of a probe in the brain ++ Probes typically fine-wire electrodes ++ Microelectrodes can monitor and stimulate a single neuron ++ *big cage to keep head in one position, for animals used for lesions and direct drug administration* #AOSR/4pc5o/s/42b7
***
Optogenetic techniques ::  light-sensitive channels can be inserted in specific types of neurons ++ More precise than electrical stimulation ++ *take cells from algae or bacteria that open and close their ion channels dependent on light, inser ++ these genes into animal neurons, activate certain parts of brain due to light *++ *more precise* #AOSR/4pc5o/s/1c1g
***
Chemical stimulation via cannulation++ *change chemical makeup around neurons*++ *canulation = tiny tube inserted into brain, drugs inserted into it* ++ **Microdialysis** ::  a more complex variation of cannulation #AOSR/4pc5o/s/55nk
***
Natural experiments ::  historically, brain damaged patients were a rich source of brain research ++ Damage may overlap different functional areas ++ Damage may fail to affect the entirety of a functional area #AOSR/4pc5o/s/3kgs
***
Ablation ::  surgical removal of brain tissue ++ Used for large areas imprecise ++ Often done by aspiration #AOSR/4pc5o/s/6qb5
***
Lesioning ::  surgical damaging of neural tissue ++ *often done by injecting acid or a drug (that may wear off over time)* ++ Precise and sometimes reversible #AOSR/4pc5o/s/47ca
***
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) ::  noninvasive technique using a magnet coil to induce a voltage ++ Device held over scalp and pulsed at varying rates ++ Valuable in both research and therapeutically ++ Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) ++ 	*uses electricity instead of magnet* ++ 	*targets astrocites instead of neurons* #AOSR/4pc5o/s/5pm5
