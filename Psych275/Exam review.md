Golgi stain  ::  ::   randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide ++Really pretty, stains entire neuron, shows us general neuron shape #AOSR/4pc5o/s/7j4v

***
Immunocytochemistry  ::  ::   uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components ++Like fMRI, doesn't use radioactive tagging. ++Cells make proteins when they become active, kill animal, we send dyed antibodies into brain, antibodies latch onto proteins and dye those cells.
