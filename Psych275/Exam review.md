#Q
Golgi stain ::  randomly stains about 5% of neurons in a slide - Really pretty, stains entire neuron, shows us general neuron shape
***
Myelin stain ::  taken up by the fatty myelin surrounding axons - shows us the axons, good at visualizing the neural pathways + connections
***
Nissl stain ::  identifies cell bodies of neurons - Where and how many are the cell bodies?
***
Retrograde stains ::  taken up by neuron terminals and transported up the axons to cell bodies - Injected into brain of animal while alive, gets taken up by axon terminals of one cell and sucks it backwards to dendrites.- Lets us see what parts of brain send info to the part we injected
***
Autoradiography ::  stains and reveals which neurons are active - Basically a post death PET scan, give organism radioactive tagged glucose, organism does task, this causes more active cells to absorb more glucose, take organism out back, do scan, brain parts that used radioactive glucose light up
***
Immunocytochemistry ::  uses antibodies attached to a dye to identify cell components - Like fMRI, doesn't use radioactive tagging. - Cells make proteins when they become active, kill animal, we send dyed antibodies into brain, antibodies latch onto proteins and dye those cells. Locates where brain was active and also exactly how many cells were active in that area (compare brain reaction strength to stimulus.)
***
In situ hybridization ::  construction of DNA strands which complement an mRNA strand - Like ***Immunocytochemistry*** but instead of targeting proteins, we target mRNA
