# Neurons
- Conveys sensory info to the brain, carry out operations,transmit commands to the body
- Structure
	- Cell body
	- Nucleus
	- Dendrites
	- Axon
	- Axon terminals

## Types of neurons
- **Motor:** Carries commands to muscles and organs
- **Sensory:** Carries info from body and outside world to spinal cord and brain
- **Interneurons:** Connect one neuron to another in the same part of the brain or spinal cord (most common, can look weird)

> Most motor and sensory neurons look like bipolar neuron
> interneurons can look real weird, axon is on the right in this example
> Unipolar neuron has dendrites and axon coming out of the same spot and then a split (some sensory neurons)
# Cell membrane

## Energy and the Cell Membrane
- **Polarization:** When there is a difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of a neuron
- **Voltage:** measure of difference in electrical charge between two points
- **Resting potential:** difference of charge (*Voltage*) between inside and outside of membrane at neuron rest ==On average -70mV==
- **Ions:** atoms that have lost or gained electrons
	- Positive: Na+, K+
	- Negative: Cl-, A- 
		- *A* = "organic anions"
	- at rest:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240116094853.png|500]]
		- Inside of cell is negative due to excess Anions
		- Outside is positive due to excess of Na+
### What Moves the Ions?
- **Force of diffusion:** tendency of ions to move through membrane to less concentrated side\
	- Normal diffusion
- **Electrostatic pressure:** force where ions are repelled from similarly charged, attracted to oppositely charged
	- opposites attract, like magnets
- **Sodium potassium pump:** large protein molecules that move sodium ions through cell membrane to outside, potassium ions back inside
	- In previous image
	- *3 `Na+` out to 2 `K-` in* 
#### Ion channels
- **Ion channels:** gated pores in the membrane formed by proteins; limit the flow of ions into and out of the cell (different gates for different ions)
- Can be **chemically gated** or **electrically gated**
	- **Chemically:** neurotransmitters or hormones
	- **Electrically:** change in electrical potential of the membrane

## Depolarization
- **Local potential:** *partial depolarization*
	- Polarity in an area shifts toward zero when disturbed
- Local potential is a **graded potential**
	- Varies in magnitude with the strength of the stimulus that produced it
- If *local potential* **exceeds the threshold** for activating electrically gated channels, then an *action potential occurs*
	- ==Threshold is usually only 10mV more positive==

- **Action potential:** *abrupt depolarization* of membrane that allows neuron to communicate
	- ![[Pasted image 20240116095737.png]]
	- Action potential is **ungraded**
		- **All-or-none law:** occurs at full strength or it does not occur at all
		- (Like an atomic transaction)
	- Action potential is **nondecremental**
		- Travels down the axon *without any decrease in size*
		- *Propagated at each successive point along the way*
	- **Process**:
		- Opens electrically gated Na+ channels
		- Na+ enters cell
		- Charge increases in cell (More positive, up to +30mV)
		- Na+ channels Close
		- Electrically gated K- channels open
		- K- Leaves cell
		- Charge decreases in cell (More negative, down to BELOW -70mV (-90 ish), **Hyperpolarzation**)
		- K- channels close

### Refractory Periods
- **Absolute refractory period:** sodium ion channels are *unresponsive* to further stimulation
	- A new action potential *cannot* occur
- **Relative refractory period:** sodium ion channels *could support another action potential*, but *potassium channels are still open*
	- A new action potential *can* occur, if the *stimulation is sufficiently strong enough* to overcome the charge
- **Rate Law**: axon encodes stimulus intensity not in the size of its action potential but in its *firing rate*
