# Neurons
- Conveys sensory info to the brain, carry out operations, transmit commands to the body
- Structure
	- Cell body
	- Nucleus
	- Dendrites
	- Axon
	- Axon terminals

## Types of neurons
- **Motor:** Carries commands to muscles and organs
- **Sensory:** Carries info from body and outside world to spinal cord and brain
- **Interneurons:** Connect one neuron to another in the same part of the brain or spinal cord (most common, can look weird)
![[Pasted image 20240116093527.png]]
> Most motor and sensory neurons look like bipolar neuron
> interneurons can look real weird, axon is on the right in this example
> Unipolar neuron has dendrites and axon coming out of the same spot and then a split (some sensory neurons)
# Cell membrane
![[Pasted image 20240116093552.png]]
## Energy and the Cell Membrane
- **Polarization:** When there is a difference in electrical charge between the inside and outside of a neuron
- **Voltage:** measure of difference in electrical charge between two points
- **Resting potential:** difference of charge (*Voltage*) between inside and outside of membrane at neuron rest ==On average -70mV==
- **Ions:** atoms that have lost or gained electrons
	- Positive: Na+, K+
	- Negative: Cl-, A- 
		- *A* = "organic anions"
	- at rest:
		- ![[Pasted image 20240116094853.png|500]]
		- Inside of cell is negative due to excess Anions
		- Outside is positive due to excess of Na+
### What Moves the Ions?
- **Force of diffusion:** tendency of ions to move through membrane to less concentrated side\
	- Normal diffusion
- **Electrostatic pressure:** force where ions are repelled from similarly charged, attracted to oppositely charged
	- opposites attract, like magnets
- **Sodium potassium pump:** large protein molecules that move sodium ions through cell membrane to outside, potassium ions back inside
	- In previous image
	- *3 `Na+` out to 2 `K-` in* 
#### Ion channels
- **Ion channels:** gated pores in the membrane formed by proteins; limit the flow of ions into and out of the cell (different gates for different ions)
- Can be **chemically gated** or **electrically gated**
	- **Chemically:** neurotransmitters or hormones
	- **Electrically:** change in electrical potential of the membrane

## Depolarization
- **Local potential:** *partial depolarization*
	- Polarity in an area shifts toward zero when disturbed
- Local potential is a **graded potential**
	- Varies in magnitude with the strength of the stimulus that produced it
- If *local potential* **exceeds the threshold** for activating electrically gated channels, then an *action potential occurs*
	- ==Threshold is usually only 10mV more positive==

- **Action potential:** *abrupt depolarization* of membrane that allows neuron to communicate
	- ![[Pasted image 20240116095737.png]]
	- Action potential is **ungraded**
		- **All-or-none law:** occurs at full strength or it does not occur at all
		- (Like an atomic transaction)
	- Action potential is **nondecremental**
		- Travels down the axon *without any decrease in size*
		- *Propagated at each successive point along the way*
	- **Process**:
		- Opens electrically gated Na+ channels
		- Na+ enters cell
		- Charge increases in cell (More positive, up to +30mV)
		- Na+ channels Close
		- Electrically gated K- channels open
		- K- Leaves cell
		- Charge decreases in cell (More negative, down to BELOW -70mV (-90 ish), **Hyperpolarzation**)
		- K- channels close
		- Cell returns to resting potential with previously discussed techniques.

### Refractory Periods
- **Absolute refractory period:** sodium ion channels are *unresponsive* to further stimulation
	- A new action potential *cannot* occur
	- ensures signal *only goes one direction*
	- 1-2 ms
- **Relative refractory period:** sodium ion channels *could support another action potential*, but *potassium channels are still open*
	- A new action potential *can* occur, if the *stimulation is sufficiently strong enough* to overcome the charge
	- 3-4 ms
- **Rate Law**: axon encodes stimulus intensity not in the size of its action potential but in its *firing rate*
# Glial Cells
- **Nonneural** cells that provide a number of supporting functions to neurons
	- Still considered a neuron
## Myelination and Conduction Speed
- **Myelin:** fatty tissue that wraps around axon to insulate it
	- Keeps cell separate from extracellular fluid and other neurons
- **Nodes of Ranvier:** Gaps in the myelin sheath
- **Saltatory conduction:** A form of transmission in which action potentials appear to jump from node to node

- What are the benefits of the myelin sheath?
	- **Reduces capacitance**
		- Electrical effect of the membrane, slows movement of ions down the axon
	- **Signal regeneration at nodes of Ranvier**
		- Na+, K- pumps only need to be used in gaps
	- **Use less energy**
	- Equivalent to increasing the diameter of the axon 100x
## Myelin-Producing Glial Cells
- **Oligodendrocytes:** Glial cells which produce myelin in the brain and spinal cord *(CNS)*
	- Almost *75%* of glial cells in the brain are oligodendrocytes
- **Schwann cells:** Glial cells which produce myelin in the rest of the nervous system *(PNS)*
![[Pasted image 20240116101809.png]]
> Oligodendrocytes use "arms" to coat axons
> Schwann cells wrap around once like a burito
## Other Glial Functions
- **Radial glia:** during fetal development they form “scaffolds” that guide new neurons to their destinations
- **Microglia:** provide energy to neurons and respond to injury and disease by removing cellular debris
- **Astrocytes:** trigger the formation of seven times as many connections in neurons
	- Do kinda everything
		- learning
		- blood brain barrier
		- recycling of neurotransmitter
# How Neurons Communicate
- **Synapse:** the connection between two neurons
- **Synaptic cleft:** the *small gap* which separates neurons so they are not in direct physical contact at the synapse
- **Presynaptic:** transmitting neuron
- **Postsynaptic:** receiving neuron
![[Pasted image 20240118093619.png|400]]
- Chemical Transmission at the Synapse
	- First shown by Otto Loewi in the early 1900s
		- Neurons release at least two different chemicals that have opposite effects
## Chemical Transmission at the Synapse
- **Vesicles:** membrane-enclose bubbles at axon terminals which store neurotransmitters
- **Ionotropic receptors:** receptors which form the ion channel and open quickly to produce the immediate reactions
	- Lock and key, bind and channel opens
- **Metabotropic receptors:** receptors which open channels indirectly through a second messenger
	- Tell keyholder to open door, two step process, a little slower
## Excitation and Inhibition
- **Partial depolarization:** depolarization which is *excitatory and facilitates the occurrence of an action potential*
- **Hyperpolarization:** increased polarization which is *inhibitory and makes an action potential less likely to occur*

- **Excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP):** when *receptors open sodium channels* to produce a *partial depolarization* of the dendrites and cell body
- **Inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP):** when *receptors open potassium channels, chloride channels, or both* to produce a *hyperpolarization* of the dendrites and cell body
## Postsynaptic Integration (happens with both EPSPs and IPSPs)
- **Spatial summation:** combines potentials occurring simultaneously at different locations on the dendrites and cell body
	- add all input across all dendrites that arrive at same time, once threshold is met, action potential
- **Temporal summation:** combines potentials arriving a short time apart, from either the same or separate inputs
	- add all input that arrives over a short period of time, once threshold is met, action potential

## Removing Neurotransmitters
- **Reuptake:** transmitters taken back into the terminals by transporter proteins, where they are repackaged into vesicles for reuse
## Regulating Synaptic Activity
- **Presynaptic excitation:** *increases the presynaptic neuron’s release of neurotransmitter* onto the postsynaptic neuron
- **Presynaptic inhibition:** *decreases the presynaptic neuron’s release of neurotransmitter* onto the postsynaptic neuron
- **Autoreceptors:** *receptors on presynaptic terminals which sense amount of transmitter in cleft*
	- Where *Presynaptic excitation* and *Inhibition* happens
![[Pasted image 20240118094937.png|400]]
## Neurotransmitters
- **Dale’s principle:** *erroneous belief* that a neuron was capable of releasing only a single transmitter
	- aka ==This is WRONG
- Neurotransmitter release:
	- Usually neurons will hold 2 neurotransmitters (sometimes more than 2)
		- Usually paired for function
		- one fast acting
		- one slow acting
	- **Corelease**
		- Vesicles contain and release *more than one neurotransmitter*
		- can control release so that only the small neurotransmitter get released (see diagram)
	- **Cotransmission**
		- Vesicles store and release *only one type of neurotransmitters* each
	- **Release of different transmitters from various terminals**
		- Different vesicles for each axon terminal
![[Pasted image 20240118095118.png]]
## Neural Codes and Neural Networks
- **Neural codes:** Varied intervals between spikes in nerve signals
	- Like morse codes for neurons to understand
- **Neural networks:** groups of neurons that function together
- **Human Connectome Project:** large-scale, multi-university effort to map brain’s circuits
## In Perspective
- It’s impossible to understand the brain (or behavior it produces) without understanding capabilities and limitations of the neuron.
- Modern tools and cooperative efforts are the key to moving forward in biological-psychology research.
