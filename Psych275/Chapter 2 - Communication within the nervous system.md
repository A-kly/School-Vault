## Types of neurons
- **Motor:** Carries commands to muscles and organs
- **Sensory:** Carries info from body and outside world to spinal cord and brain
- **Interneurons:** Connect one neuron to another in the same part of the brain or spinal cord (most common, can look weird)

> Most motor and sensory neurons look like bipolar neuron
> interneurons can look real weird, axon is on the right in this example
> Unipolar neuron has dendrites and axon coming out of the same spot and then a split (some sensory neurons)
