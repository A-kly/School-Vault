# What is Emotion?
- **Emotion:** an increase or decrease in physiological activity accompanied by feelings that are characteristic of the emotion
- Often accompanied by characteristic behavior or facial expression
# Sympathetic NS Activation
- **Sympathetic nervous system:** activates the body during arousal
	- Increases heart rate, respiration, sweat gland activity
	- Shuts down digestion
	- Constricts peripheral blood vessels
		- Raises the blood pressure and diverts blood to the muscles
	- Stimulates the adrenal glands to release hormones
		- Cortisol
# Parasympathetic NS Activation
- **Parasympathetic nervous system:** shuts down the body following arousal
	- Decreases heart rate, respiration
	- Resumes digestion
	- Peripheral blood vessels back to normal
# Muscular Activation
- Muscular activation involved in external expression of emotion
	- Smiling, frowning, running away
- Autonomic and muscular arousal are adaptive
	- Prepare the body for an emergency and help it carry out an appropriate response
- Contributions to emotion?
# The Role of Feedback From the Body
- **James Lange theory:** emotional experience comes from physiological arousal that precedes it
	- Different emotions are result of different patterns of arousal

- **Cognitive theory:** belief that identity of an emotion is based on cognitive assessment of a situation
	- Physiological arousal contributes only to emotion’s intensity
- James-Lang or Cognitive theory?
	- Both and neither
	- nduced facial expressions influence the interpretation of environmental
stimuli
