# What is Emotion?
- **Emotion:** an increase or decrease in physiological activity accompanied by feelings that are characteristic of the emotion
- Often accompanied by characteristic behavior or facial expression
# Sympathetic NS Activation
- **Sympathetic nervous system:** activates the body during arousal
	- Increases heart rate, respiration, sweat gland activity
	- Shuts down digestion
	- Constricts peripheral blood vessels
		- Raises the blood pressure and diverts blood to the muscles
	- Stimulates the adrenal glands to release hormones
		- Cortisol
# Parasympathetic NS Activation
- **Parasympathetic nervous system:** shuts down the body following arousal
	- Decreases heart rate, respiration
	- Resumes digestion
	- Peripheral blood vessels back to normal
# Muscular Activation
- Muscular activation involved in external expression of emotion
	- Smiling, frowning, running away
- Autonomic and muscular arousal are adaptive
	- Prepare the body for an emergency and help it carry out an appropriate response
- Contributions to emotion?
# The Role of Feedback From the Body
- **James Lange theory:** emotional experience comes from physiological arousal that precedes it
	- Different emotions are result of different patterns of arousal

- **Cognitive theory:** belief that identity of an emotion is based on cognitive assessment of a situation
	- Physiological arousal contributes only to emotion’s intensity
- James-Lang or Cognitive theory?
	- Both and neither
	- Induced facial expressions influence the interpretation of environmental stimuli
	- May also help us empathize with others
# Mirror Neurons
- **Mirror neurons:** neurons that fire both when we engage in a specific act and while observing the same act in others
# The Limbic System
- Limbic system: network of structures arranged around upper brain stem
	- Central to emotion, motivation, learning, and memory

# How Do We Study Emotion?
- Mainly lesioning and stimulation studies with non-human animals
	- Disconnect because we don’t know what the animal is experiencing
- Humans with electrodes for other kinds of treatments led to insights
- Now use brain imaging
## Stimulating Brain Structures
- **Hypothalamus:** primary control over the autonomic system
- Produces general autonomic activation
- Accompanied by feelings of fear, rage, or pleasure, depending on the location of the electrode

# Brain Structure Involvement
- **Amygdala:** small limbic system structure near lateral ventricle of temporal lobes
- Associated with fear and anxiety
	- Short SLC6A4 allele - reduced serotonin and increased fear/anxiety due to a hyper-responsive amygdala
	- Rats with a damaged amygdala will approach and interact with a sedated cat
	- Patients with bilateral amygdala damage do not experience traditional fear responses to external stimuli

- **Insular cortex and basal ganglia involved in disgust**
	- Insula is the cortical projection site for taste
	- Basal ganglia involved in motor functions
- **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC):** brain structure best known for roles in attention, decision-making, and impulse control
	- Also plays major role in emotion
