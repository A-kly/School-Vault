# What is Emotion?
- **Emotion:** an increase or decrease in physiological activity accompanied by feelings that are characteristic of the emotion
- Often accompanied by characteristic behavior or facial expression
# Sympathetic NS Activation
- **Sympathetic nervous system:** activates the body during arousal
	- Increases heart rate, respiration, sweat gland activity
	- Shuts down digestion
	- Constricts peripheral blood vessels
		- Raises the blood pressure and diverts blood to the muscles
	- Stimulates the adrenal glands to release hormones
		- Cortisol
# Parasympathetic NS Activation
- **Parasympathetic nervous system:** shuts down the body following arousal
	- Decreases heart rate, respiration
	- Resumes digestion
	- Peripheral blood vessels back to normal
# Muscular Activation
- Muscular activation involved in external expression of emotion
	- Smiling, frowning, running away
- Autonomic and muscular arousal are adaptive
	- Prepare the body for an emergency and help it carry out an appropriate response
- Contributions to emotion?
# The Role of Feedback From the Body
- **James Lange theory:** emotional experience comes from physiological arousal that precedes it
	- Different emotions are result of different patterns of arousal
	- ![[Pasted image 20240307093852.png]]
- **Cognitive theory:** belief that identity of an emotion is based on cognitive assessment of a situation
	- Physiological arousal contributes only to emotion’s intensity
- James-Lang or Cognitive theory?
	- Both and neither
	- Induced facial expressions influence the interpretation of environmental stimuli
	- May also help us empathize with others
# Mirror Neurons
- **Mirror neurons:** neurons that fire both when we engage in a specific act and while observing the same act in others
# The Limbic System
- Limbic system: network of structures arranged around upper brain stem
	- Central to emotion, motivation, learning, and memory
![[Pasted image 20240307094028.png|500]]
# How Do We Study Emotion?
- Mainly lesioning and stimulation studies with non-human animals
	- Disconnect because we don’t know what the animal is experiencing
- Humans with electrodes for other kinds of treatments led to insights
- Now use brain imaging
## Stimulating Brain Structures
- **Hypothalamus:** primary control over the autonomic system
- Produces general autonomic activation
- Accompanied by feelings of fear, rage, or pleasure, depending on the location of the electrode
![[Pasted image 20240307094131.png]]
# Brain Structure Involvement
- **Amygdala:** small limbic system structure near lateral ventricle of temporal lobes
- Associated with fear and anxiety
	- Short SLC6A4 allele - reduced serotonin and increased fear/anxiety due to a hyper-responsive amygdala
	- Rats with a damaged amygdala will approach and interact with a sedated cat
	- Patients with bilateral amygdala damage do not experience traditional fear responses to external stimuli
![[Pasted image 20240307094235.png|500]]
- **Insular cortex and basal ganglia involved in disgust**
	- Insula is the cortical projection site for taste
	- Basal ganglia involved in motor functions
- **Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC):** brain structure best known for roles in attention, decision-making, and impulse control
	- Also plays major role in emotion
# Stress, Immunity, and Health
- **Stress:** condition in environment that makes unusual demands on an organism
	- Threat, failure, or bereavement
- Stress is also the response to a stressful situation
	- Bodily response
## Stress as an Adaptive Response
- Short-term stress responses can be beneficial
- *Hypothalamus* stimulates *adrenal medulla* to release epinephrine and norepinephrine
	- Increase output from the heart and liberate glucose from the muscles for additional energy
- Also releases *cortisol*
	- Increases in metabolism, glucose availability, and blood supply to the skeletal muscles
## Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis
- Hypothalamus releases **corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)**
- CRH stimulates the synthesis and release of **adrenocorticotropic hormone** (ACTH) from the **pituitary gland**
- ACTH binds to the **adrenal cortex** and triggers release of **cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine**
- Triggers stress-reducing response from target organs
	- Decreases subsequent release of hormones in this pathway
![[Pasted image 20240307101348.png|500]]
## Stress and Our Immune System
- **Leukocytes (white blood cells):** recognize invaders by the unique proteins (antigens) that every cell has on its surface and kills them
	- **Macrophage:** ingests invaders and displays foreign antigens
	- **T cells:** attracted by specific antigens
	- **B cells:** produce antibodies that attack a particular cell type
- **Natural killer cells:** attack and destroy certain kinds of cancer cells and cells infected with viruses
	- Less specific in their targets than T or B cells
- Central nervous system is protected from most infectious agents by the blood- brain barrier
	- **Microglia** act like macrophages vs any agents that get through

## Stress as a Negative Response
- Prolonged stress has negative side effects:
	- Memory interference
	- Appetite changes
	- Diminished sexual desire and performance
	- Depleted energy
	- Disrupted mood
	- Compromised immune system
	- Worsened concentration
![[Pasted image 20240307101606.png]]
- **Sudden cardiac death:** excessive sympathetic activity with stress sends heart into fibrillation, contracting so rapidly that it pumps little or no blood
- Chronic stress can produce structural and functional degeneration in the brain
	- ![[Pasted image 20240307101703.png]]
## Social, Personality, & Genetic Factors
- Associations have been found between personality traits and vulnerability for or protection against disease
	- **Type D “distressed” personality** linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease
	- Introverted HIV-infected individuals may have up to eight times higher viral load
	- People with a strong support network are healthier and live longer
- Personality characteristics such as introversion are moderately heritable, as is vulnerability to stress
- Study of 300 Swedish twins concluded that 32% of workplace stress is genetic (Judge, Ilies, & Zhang, 2012)
- Stress has ability to modify the expression of genes
## Pain as an Adaptive Emotion
- Pain is a sense closely linked with emotion
- **Congenital insensitivity to pain:** rare genetic disorder of PNS in which people are unable to sense pain
	- Prone to injury
- Somatosensory cortex as primary projection area for pain
- Also activates anterior cingulate cortex, which connects to limbic system
![[Pasted image 20240307101917.png|500]]
- Prolonged pain recruits prefrontal cortex
	- Pain is evaluated and responses to the painful situation are planned
# Aggression
- **Aggression:** forceful or assertive behavior that is intended to harm or control another
	- **Predatory aggression:** aggression that occurs when an animal attacks and kills its prey or when a human makes a premeditated, unprovoked attack on another
	- **Affective aggression:** aggression characterized by its impulsiveness and emotional arousal
	- **Proactive (instrumental) aggression:** aggression that is unprovoked and emotionless, and is intended to bring about some gain for the aggressor
	- **Reactive (impulsive) aggression:** aggression that occurs in response to a threat, real or imagined, and is characterized by heightened emotionality
## Biological Origins of Aggression
- Aggression involves network of structures:
	- *Amygdala* - detects and responds to threats
	- *Prefrontal cortex* - moderates aggression with regard to amygdala
	- *Hypothalamus* - primary instigator of aggressive behavior
	- *Insula and anterior cingulate* (when emotion is involved)
# Hormones and Neurotransmitters
- **Testosterone:** plays a role in animals and both male and female human aggression
	- Significant global effects in the brain and on behavior
	- Reduces functional connectivity between orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, leading to poor emotion regulation
	- Relationship between aggression and testosterone highly variable without considering other influences
![[Pasted image 20240307102506.png|500]]
- **Serotonin:** conventionally inhibitory, suppressing motivated behaviors
	- Research suggests role in aggression is no different
	- Low serotonin linked to impulsive aggression
- **Cortisol** is also inhibitory to aggression
	- Male prisoners with low cortisol had high levels of calculating and unemotional aggression
- One hypothesis suggests testosterone, cortisol, and serotonin interreact to determine whether and how aggression will occur
## Heredity and Environment
- Review of 40 studies concluded that about 50% of variability in aggressive behavior can be accounted for by genes
- *MAOA* gene encodes monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), an enzyme that degrades serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine
	- Deficiencies in MAOA activity associated with impulsive aggression
![[Pasted image 20240307102656.png|500]]
- Environmental influences account for other half of variability in aggression:
	- Childhood abuse (physical or sexual)
	- Family adversity
	- Low socioeconomic status
	- Pre-adulthood cannabis consumption or alcohol abuse
	- Living in a big city
