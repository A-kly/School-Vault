# Central Nervous System
- **Central nervous system (CNS):** includes the brain and spinal cord
## Important Terminology (on exam)
- **NOTE:** Nerve =/= Neuron
	- **Neuron:** single cell
	- **Nerve:** bundle of axons running together
		- term only used in peripheral nervous system
	- **Tract:** a bundle of axons running together in the CNS
- **Nucleus:** group of cell bodies in CNS
- **Ganglion:** group of cell bodies in PNS

## The Forebrain
- Major structures:
	- two cerebral hemispheres
	- the thalamus
	- the hypothalamus
### The Cerebral Hemispheres
- **Cerebral hemispheres:** large, wrinkled structures dominating brain’s appearance
	- The dorsal or superior part of the brain and that are covered by the **cortex**
	- **Longitudinal fissure:** division running length of the brain separating cerebral hemispheres
![[Pasted image 20240123093918.png|400]]
- **Gyrus:** each ridge in surface of the brain
- **Sulcus:** groove or space between two gyri
- **Fissure:** large groove or space between two gyri
	- Extra big *Sulcus*, deeper
- **Cortex:** outer surface of brain; literally, “bark”
	- Mostly made up of the cell bodies of neurons
	- ==more surface area because of more gyri and sulci = more cortex = more high level thinking==
		- Smooth brain = less cortex
### The Cortex
- 1.4 to 4.0 mm thick
- Important for higher level cognition, high level thinking
- Convolutions provide 3x surface area
	- **Convolutions:** Gyri and Sulci
	- Also allow more access to cell bodies

- In image b) each column can be 80-100 cells wide.
- Each column can be thought of controlling one thing, grouped by function in a certain area
#### Layers of the Cortex
(look at image a) above)
- Layer I is inhibitory.
- Layers II and III are associational.
- Layer IV is sensory.
- Layers V and VI have motor functions.

- Sometimes layers just like aren't there if we don't need them
# Brain Size and Intelligence
- Brain size is more related to body size than intelligence
- **Complexity determines intellectual power**

# Brain structure
-  Directional Terms (on exam)
	- (All of these assume we are looking straight up, OR we are on our hands and knees)
	- **Dorsal:** toward the back
	- **Ventral:** toward the stomach
	- **Anterior:** toward the front
	- **Posterior:** toward the rear
	- **Superior:** above another structure
	- **Inferior:** below another structure
	- **Lateral:** toward the side
	- **Medial:** toward the middle

## Forebrain Structures
![[Pasted image 20240123100144.png|300]]
- Motor cortex / precentral gyrus is found in the next image.
![[Pasted image 20240123102550.png]]
- We need to know **All** of these parts!
### Frontal lobe
- Precentral gyrus (Motor cortex)
- Broca's area
	- Speech formation
	- *Only on left hemisphere*
- Prefrontal Cortex (largest region of brain, 29% of cortex)
	- Planning, organizing of behaviours
	- decision making
	- goals
	- adjusting behaviour because of consequences
#### Psychosurgery
- **Psychosurgery:** use of surgical intervention to treat cognitive and emotional disorders
	- **Lobotomy:** involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex
		- REALLY BAD
	- **Corpus callosotomy:** involves cutting corpus callosum to limit spread of epileptic activity between hemispheres

### Parietal lobe
- Postcentral gyrus (somatosensory cortex)
	- Receives all sensory info to be processed
	- Organized in the same way that the motor cortex
-  has **Association Areas**
	- **Association areas:** Areas which carry out further processing beyond what the primary area does, often combining information from other senses
#### Neglect
- **Neglect:** A disorder in which the person *ignores objects, people, and activity on the side opposite the damage*
	- Neglect occurs most often when the *posterior parietal cortex is damaged, particularly if the damage occurs in the right parietal lobe*

### Temporal Lobes
- **Temporal lobes:** Regions containing the *auditory projection area*, *visual and auditory association areas*, an *additional language area*, and *structures important in learning and memory*
- **Inferior temporal cortex:** plays major role in *visual identification of objects*
	- Damage can lead to face blindless
- **Wernicke's area:** Responsible for speech understanding, take audio and processes it into meaning, and vice versa. 
	- Deals with auditory, written and reading language
	- *Only on left hemisphere*
-  also has **Association Areas**
	- **Association areas:** Areas which carry out further processing beyond what the primary area does, often combining information from other senses
### Occipital lobe
- **Visual cortex:** process vision
	- Most posterior part is the **primary visual cortex**
	- everything else is **secondary visual cortex**
### The Rest of The Forebrain
- **Thalamus:** receives information from all sensory systems except olfaction (smell)
	- Receives info before cortex
	- information switchboard
- **Hypothalamus:** plays major role in controlling emotion and motivated behaviors
	- produces hormones to regulate emotions
- **Pineal gland:** secretes melatonin, a hormone that induces sleep
	- sleeby
- **Corpus callosum:** band of fibers that carry information between brain hemispheres

![[Pasted image 20240125093432.png|500]]
#### The Ventricles
![[Pasted image 20240125093527.png]]
- **Ventricles:** cavities in brain which develop from the hollow interior of the nervous system
- **Cerebrospinal fluid:** carries material from blood vessels to the CNS and transports waste materials in the other direction
## Midbrain Structures
![[Pasted image 20240125093933.png|300]]
- **Midbrain:** structures have secondary roles in vision, hearing, and movement
- **Superior colliculi**
	- help guide eye movements and fixation of gaze
- **Inferior colliculi**
	- help locate the direction of sounds
- Midbrain also includes:
	- **Substantia nigra**
		- *Blue area, not bumps*
		- Involved in movement
## Hindbrain Structures
![[Pasted image 20240125093933.png|300]]
- Hindbrain:
	- Pons
		- Regulates sleep and arousal
		- Helps reticular formation
	- Reticular formation
		- *In between Pons, also extends into midbrain*
		- Regulates sleep and arousal
		- Plays a role in attention
	- Medulla
		- *Lower part of hindbrain, First 1-2cm of spinal cord*
		- Lots of nuclei
		- Essential for controlling life processes, breathing, heartbeat
	- Cerebellum (contains 70% of the brain's neurons, most of them "we have no clue what the fuck they do")
		- Mini brain, small role in every function in the entire brain
		- Modifying/refining movement and balance
==The Brain Stem: Midbrain+hindbrain== (ON EXAM)
# The Spinal Cord
- **Spinal cord:** finger-sized cable of neurons that carries commands from brain to muscles and organs, and sensory information into the brain
	- **Dorsal root:** A region of each spinal nerve where sensory neurons enter the spinal cord
	- **Ventral root:** The region in which axons of motor neurons pass out of the spinal cord
![[Pasted image 20240125095306.png]]
- Thoracic:
	- Arms, internal organs
- Lumbar
	- Intestines, legs and feet
- Sacral
	- Assssss
- Coccygeal
	- Rectum
## Reflexes
- **Reflex:** simple, automatic movement in response to sensory stimulus
![[Pasted image 20240125095333.png]]
- Sensory and motor info cross to other side inside of the spinal cord
- Interneuron activates reflex based on the strength of the signal
## Protecting the Central Nervous System
- ==Blood kills neurons, we have to separate the two==
- **Meninges:** protective three-layered membrane, protect from tauma
	- Surrounds entire CNS
	- **Outer layer: Dura**
		- Thick, tough, (tougher than skin)
	- **Middle layer: Arachnoid Layer**
		- Looks like a spider web
		- Separates blood and Cerebrospinal fluid
		- lots of little tubes
	- **Inner layer: Pia Mater Layer**
		- Super thin
		- Helps protect the brain from trauma
		- Keeps brain as one solid unit
- **Blood-brain barrier:** limits passage between bloodstream and the brain, provides constant protection from toxic substances and from neurotransmitters circulating in the blood
	- Blood vessel, surrounded by *Astrocytes*, creating a solid wall around blood vessels.
	- Blood vessel sends nutrients to *astrocytes* which send it to the brain
	- *Astrocytes* send waste from brain to blood vessels
	- Things that can't pass:
		- drugs
		- cold viruses
		- anything water soluble
		- neurotransmitters
# The Peripheral Nervous System
- **Afferent** = nerves going toward the CNS
- **Efferent** = nerves going away from the CNS
- **Peripheral nervous system** – nerves that lie outside the central nervous system
	- **Cranial nerves:** Nerves which enter and leave the underside of the brain
	- ![[Pasted image 20240125101837.png|400]]
		- Names are important, functions are not necessarily
	- **Spinal nerves:** Nerves which connect to the sides of the spinal cord at each vertebra
- **Somatic nervous system** – voluntary muscles and sensory receptors
- **Autonomic nervous system** (ANS) – controls automatic, involuntary functions
	- **Sympathetic** – Go (fight-or-flight)
	- **Parasympathetic** – Stop

# Development and Change in the Nervous System
## The Stages of Development
![[Pasted image 20240125102936.png]]
- This is a Neural Tube (NOT A DICK)
- Hole in middle of tube becomes ventricles

- **Proliferation:** the cells that will become neurons divide and multiply rapidly
- **Migration:** newly formed neurons move from the ventricular zone to their final location 
	- Radial glial cells guide migrating neurons.
	- *Cells migrate through ventricles*
- **Circuit formation:** the axons of developing neurons grow toward their target cells and form functional connections
	- *Growth cone* helps axon "sniff out" where to go correctly.
- **Circuit pruning:** the elimination of excess neurons and synapses
	- **Plasticity:** ability of synapses to be modified
		- Happens throughout entire life
	- **Reorganization:** shift in connection that changes function of an area of the brain
		- eg, After amputation, brain takes part of brain that used to control amputated thing and reuses it for something else!
## Damage and Recovery in the CNS
- **Stroke:** condition caused by loss of blood flow to the brain (neurons die)
	- Ischemic
		- Caused by blockage of an artery by a blood clot, causing suffocation of brain
	- hemorrhagic
		- When an artery in the brain ruptures, and the blood kills brain cells
- **Traumatic brain injury (TBI):** condition caused by external mechanical force, sudden acceleration or deceleration, or penetration
## Limitations on Recovery
- **Regeneration:** growth of severed axons
	- Axons can grow back sometimes
	- Happens in PNS as long as there is the skeleton of the old myelin sheath
	- not the best in PNS
	- better in CNS but only by a bit
- **Neurogenesis:** birth of new neurons
	- As you age, less neurogenesis occurs
	- happens a lot in hippocampus
	- not much in other parts of the brain
## Compensation and Reorganization
- **Compensation:** uninjured tissue takes over function of lost neurons
- **Stem cells:** undifferentiated cells that can develop into specialized cells, such as neurons, muscle, or blood cells
# In Perspective
- While we know a great deal about the brain and its functions, we haven’t scratched the surface
	- A solid foundation now exists
