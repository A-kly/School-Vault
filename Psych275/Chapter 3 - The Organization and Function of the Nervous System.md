# Central Nervous System
- **Central nervous system (CNS):** includes the brain and spinal cord
## Important Terminology (on exam)
- **NOTE:** Nerve =/= Neuron
	- **Neuron:** single cell
	- **Nerve:** bundle of axons running together
		- term only used in peripheral nervous system
	- **Tract:** a bundle of axons running together in the CNS
- **Nucleus:** group of cell bodies in CNS
- **Ganglion:** group of cell bodies in PNS

## The Forebrain
- Major structures:
	- two cerebral hemispheres
	- the thalamus
	- the hypothalamus
### The Cerebral Hemispheres
- **Cerebral hemispheres:** large, wrinkled structures dominating brain’s appearance
	- The dorsal or superior part of the brain and that are covered by the **cortex**
	- **Longitudinal fissure:** division running length of the brain separating cerebral hemispheres
![[Pasted image 20240123093918.png|400]]
- **Gyrus:** each ridge in surface of the brain
- **Sulcus:** groove or space between two gyri
- **Fissure:** large groove or space between two gyri
	- Extra big *Sulcus*, deeper
- **Cortex:** outer surface of brain; literally, “bark”
	- Mostly made up of the cell bodies of neurons
	- ==more surface area because of more gyri and sulci = more cortex = more high level thinking==
		- Smooth brain = less cortex
### The Cortex
- 1.4 to 4.0 mm thick
- Important for higher level cognition, high level thinking
- Convolutions provide 3x surface area
	- **Convolutions:** Gyri and Sulci
	- Also allow more access to cell bodies

- In image b) each column can be 80-100 cells wide.
- Each column can be thought of controlling one thing, grouped by function in a certain area
#### Layers of the Cortex
(look at image a) above)
- Layer I is inhibitory.
- Layers II and III are associational.
- Layer IV is sensory.
- Layers V and VI have motor functions.

- Sometimes layers just like aren't there if we don't need them
# Brain Size and Intelligence
- Brain size is more related to body size than intelligence
- **Complexity determines intellectual power**

# Brain structure
-  Directional Terms (on exam)
	- (All of these assume we are looking straight up, OR we are on our hands and knees)
	- **Dorsal:** toward the back
	- **Ventral:** toward the stomach
	- **Anterior:** toward the front
	- **Posterior:** toward the rear
	- **Superior:** above another structure
	- **Inferior:** below another structure
	- **Lateral:** toward the side
	- **Medial:** toward the middle

## Brain Structures
![[Pasted image 20240123100144.png|300]]
- Motor cortex / precentral gyrus is found in the next image in the red circles 
![[Pasted image 20240123095548.png|600]]
- We need to know **All** of these parts!
### Frontal lobe
- Precentral gyrus (Motor cortex)
- Broca's area
	- Speech formation
- Prefrontal Cortex (largest region of brain, 29% of cortex)
	- Planning, organizing of behaviours
	- decision making
	- goals
	- adjusting behaviour because of consequences
#### Psychosurgery
- **Psychosurgery:** use of surgical intervention to treat cognitive and emotional disorders
	- **Lobotomy:** involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex
		- REALLY BAD
	- **Corpus callosotomy:** involves cutting corpus callosum to limit spread of epileptic activity between hemispheres

### Parietal lobe
- Postcentral gyrus (somatosensory cortex)
	- Receives all sensory info to be processed
	- Organized in the same way that the motor cortex
-  Association Areas
	- **Association areas:** Areas which carry out further processing beyond what the primary area does, often combining information from other senses
#### Neglect
- **Neglect:** A disorder in which the person *ignores objects, people, and activity on the side opposite the damage*
	- Neglect occurs most often when the *posterior parietal cortex is damaged, particularly if the damage occurs in the right parietal lobe*

### Temporal Lobes
- **Temporal lobes:** Regions containing the *auditory projection area*, *visual and auditory association areas*, an *additional language area*, and *structures important in learning and memory*
- **Inferior temporal cortex:** plays major role in visual identification of objects
