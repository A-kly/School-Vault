# Central Nervous System
- **Central nervous system (CNS):** includes the brain and spinal cord
## Important Terminology
- **NOTE:** Nerve =/= Neuron
	- **Neuron:** single cell
	- **Nerve:** bundle of axons running together
		- term only used in peripheral nervous system
	- **Tract:** a bundle of axons running together in the CNS
- **Nucleus:** group of cell bodies in CNS
- **Ganglion:** group of cell bodies in PNS

## The Forebrain
- Major structures:
	- two cerebral hemispheres
	- the thalamus
	- the hypothalamus
### The Cerebral Hemispheres
- **Cerebral hemispheres:** large, wrinkled structures dominating brain’s appearance
	- The dorsal or superior part of the brain and that are covered by the **cortex**
	- **Longitudinal fissure:** division running length of the brain separating cerebral hemispheres

- **Gyrus:** each ridge in surface of the brain
- **Sulcus:** groove or space between two gyri
- **Fissure:** large groove or space between two gyri
	- Extra big *Sulcus*, deeper
- **Cortex:** outer surface of brain; literally, “bark”
	- Mostly made up of the cell bodies of neurons
	- ==more surface area because of more gyri and sulci = more cortex = more high level thinking==
		- Smooth brain = less cortex
### The Cortex
- 1.4 to 4.0 mm thick
- Important for higher level cognition, high level thinking
- Convolutions provide 3x surface area
	- **Convolutions:** Gyri and Sulci
	- Also allow more access to cell bodies

#### Layers of the Cortex
(look at previous image)
- Layer I is inhibitory.
- Layers II and III are associational.
- Layer IV is sensory.
- Layers V and VI have motor functions.
