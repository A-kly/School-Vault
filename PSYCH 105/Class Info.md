## From syllabus:
- Achieve Learning Curves:
	- Learning Curves are activities designed to test your comprehensive understanding of the important concepts from each chapter. Each section for each chapter has itâ€™s own Learning Curve, so be sure to complete them all. These are completion based and will make up 5% of the final grade.
- Achieve Practice Quizzes:
	- Practice Quizzes will consist of multiple-choice questions based on textbook readings and will be completed through Achieve. You get 3 attempts for each quiz and I will take the best of those scores. See table below for specific due dates. The quizzes are worth 5% of the final grade.
