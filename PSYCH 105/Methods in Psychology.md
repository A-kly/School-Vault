# Experience and Intuition V.S. Science
## Pitfalls of Everyday Approaches
To understand behaviour we rely on:
- Personal Experience
- Our own intuition
### Problems with experience
- No Comparison group (only our **own** experience)
- Experience can have **confounding** variables
	- experience is not controlled enough to make clear assumptions
	- eg: try a new medication and you feel better!
		- Is it the medication? Your expectations? Nicer weather?
### Problems with Intuition
-  Bias
	- Being swayed by a good story
	- Being persuaded by what easily comes to mind
	- Failing to think about what we cannot see
	- Focusing on the evidence we like best
	- Being biased about being biased
## Science: Rationalism vs Empiricism
- **Rationalism:** the idea that knowledge can be obtained through reasoning
- **Empiricism:** the idea that knowledge can be obtained through observation and experience
### How is Science Different?
- Science is probabilistic
	- More than one person being considered
- Comparison groups
	- E.g., before vs after, no treatment vs treatment
- Systematic methods to avoid confounds
	- Control for variables or measure to include them
- Techniques to avoid biases
	- E.g., single- and double-blind designs
- Science is a public affair
	- Research is published in peer-reviewed journals
# Basics of Psychological Research

## Goals of Psychological Research
1. Measurement and description
2. Understanding and prediction
3. Application and control
## Important Definitions
- **Variable:** Any characteristic that can vary
- **Operational Definition:** Defines a variable in terms of specific procedures used to produce or measure it
	- A description in concrete, measurable terms
- **Data:** measurements collected; a set of observations
- **Theory:** set of statements that describes general principles about how variables relate to one another
- **Hypothesis:** prediction about the outcomes of your research based on theory
- **Participants/Subjects:** the organisms whose behaviour is systematically observed in a study
## What makes a good theory?
- Consistent with prior observation (i.e., predictions are supported by research)
- Conforms to law of parsimony (i.e., is as simple as possible); aka Occam’s Razor
- Specific
- Measurable
- Establish causality*
- Falsifiable – something that we can actually test
## Scientific Method

![[Pasted image 20230905162523.png]]
## How Do We Collect Data?
- **Psychological test:** a standardized measure to obtain a sample of subjects’ behaviour
- **Physiological/neural recording:** an instrument monitors and records specific physiological processes in a subject
- **Examination of archival records:** analyze existing institutional records
# Types of Research
- [[#Descriptive Research]]
	- How common is X? When does Y occur?
- [[#Correlational Research]]
	- Are X & Y related? If X changes, how will Y change?
- [[#Experimental Research]]
	- Does X cause Y? If we manipulate X, how does Y change in response?
## Descriptive Research
- Descriptive Methods: any means to capture, report, record, or otherwise describe a group
	- Naturalistic observation, Participant observation, Case studies, Surveys
- Based on a single measured variable
- Sometimes grouped with correlational research
### Naturalistic Observation
- Observe behavior without manipulation
- Most likely representative of real world behavior
- No control over behavior
- Difficult to determine exact cause of behavior
### Participant Observation
- Researcher interacts with population of interest
- Allows for research insights from participants' perspective
- May be subject to biases or interpretation
- Observations may not be repeatable
### Case study
- A report of a single person, group, or situation
- Collect a lot of detail
- Not an experiment
- Can be difficult to draw causal relationships
- eg. Patient Henry Molaison (H.M.)
	- Hipocampus removal
### Survey
-  Questions to extract specific information from a group of people
- Relatively easy to administer
- An effective approach to gather lots of information
- Susceptible to biases from both researchers and participants
### Types of Statistics
- **Statistics:** using mathematics to organize, summarize, and interpret numerical data
	- **Descriptive statistics:** organizing and summarizing data in a useful way
	- **Inferential statistics:** interpreting data and drawing conclusions
### Describing Data
- Measures of central tendency: where is the centre of the data?
	- **Mode** – most frequent value
	- **Median** – look at total number of values, divide in half, record value given for middle data point
	- **Mean** – average; center of dataset, skewed by outliers
	- ![[Pasted image 20230907162941.png|200]]
- Variability: How spread out is the data? What is the shape of the data?
	- Range – subtract lowest from highest data value
	- Standard deviation – spread of data around mean; sqrt(variance)
	- Variance – average of squared deviation scores; (standard deviation)^2
#### THE FOLLOWING IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO CONFUSING
![[Pasted image 20230907153514.png]]
### Pros & Cons of Descriptive Research
- Pros:
	- Can describe variables of interest
- Cons:
	- Do not learn about relationships or causality
	- Cannot manipulate measured variables
## Correlational Research
- At least two measured variables
- Study of the relationship between two measured variables
- unlike [[#Descriptive Research]], we are not simply measuring and describing one thing
- ==Correlation =/= causation==
### Correlation
- **Correlation coefficient (r):** describes the relationship between two variables
	- Ranges from -1.0 to +1.0
	- Sign indicates direction
	- Absolute value indicates strength
- Positive correlations
	- 0 < r ≤ +1.0
	- Increase in variable A --> **Increase** in variable B
- Negative correlations
	- -1.0 ≤ r < 0
	- Increase in variable A --> **Decrease** in variable B
- Zero Correlations
	- r=0
	- Neither Variable is dependent on another
### Scatterplots

![[Pasted image 20230907164702.png]]
### Advantages of Correlational Research
- Shows strength of relationships
- Make predictions
	- Past + future extrapolation
- Identifies "real world" associations
### Disadvantages of Correlational Research
- Cannot manipulate measured variables
	- eg. Studying amount vs grade result
- Can't assume cause/effect relationship
	- Only Correlation not causation
	- Shows association, **Not** cause
### Third variable problem
![[Pasted image 20230907162520.png]]
## Experimental Research
- At least one manipulated variable
- Not like [[#Descriptive Research]], Not just describing one measured variable
- Not like [[#Correlational Research]]], Not passively observing
- Experimental research involves **manipulating** one variable under controlled conditions to observe another variable change
	- Emphasis on our own manipulation
- Detects **Cause-effect relationships**
- Tests Theories, Hypotheses

- **Type I error:** a false positive
	- Conclusion says there is a causal relationship when there actually is not
- **Type II error:** a miss
	- Inverse of type I, Conclusion says no causal relationship but there is

Other considerations:
- **Power:** Would we be able to actually find a relationship if it exists?
- **Reliability:** How consistent is our science (manipulation and measurement)?

### Important Variables In Experiments
- **Independent variable (IV):** variable manipulated
- **Dependent variable (DV):** variable affected by manipulation
	- How does X affect Y?
	- X = independent variable, Y = dependent variable
- **Extraneous Variables:** uncontrolled events that can affect our DV
	- Aka confounding variables

### Populations and Samples
- **Population:** All individuals we want to draw a conclusion about
- **Sample:** Subset of population
- **A representative sample:** A sample that reflects the important characteristics of
the population
#### Random sampling
- Method of sampling in which every member of the population has an equal probability of being chosen to participate
![[Pasted image 20230912153327.png]]
1. Simple random sample
	- Everyone has an equal chance
2. Stratified random sample
	- Divide into subgroups and take representative samples
	- Used when there is a small number of participants (so that we don't by chance get an unrepresentative sample because our dice roll was bad)
3. Non-random sample
	- Due to study constraints, not equal chances
	- eg. Convenience sample

- Sometimes it's not possible to randomly sample.
	- We sometimes have to design research with a lack of representative sample in mind
	- This is ok if:
		1. Similarity of a sample and a population doesn’t matter
		2. Multiple experiments conducted on different samples have similar results
		3. Similarity of sample and population is sometimes reasonable

### Experimental and Control Groups
- **Experimental group:** subjects who receive some special treatment in regard to the independent variable
- **Control group:** similar subjects who do not receive the special treatment
	- Used as comparison
- We use random *assignment* to assign participants to control or experimental group
	- Stops groups from having systematic variance
- Logic:
	- Groups are as identical in possible
	- change independent variable
	- dependent variable change is due to independent variable only
Example:
![[Pasted image 20230912154218.png]]
### Placebo and The Placebo Effect
- **Placebo:** treatment that has no therapeutic effect but emulates the other aspects of a treatment
	- Fake IV that does nothing but may cause change due to expectations
- **Placebo effect:** Placebo treatment causes changes to participant/patient due to expectations of patient and not due to *IV*.
### Variations in Experimental Design
- Use more than one *dependent variable*
	- More complete picture of *IV* effect
	- ![[Pasted image 20230912155740.png|400]]
		- This study for example measures both rate of learning **and** performance accuracy
- Expose a single group to two different conditions
	- Reduces extraneous variables
	- [[#^8ae0ad|Repeated Measures study]] 
	- Measuring the same people over and over again
- Manipulate more than one *independent variable*
	- Allows for study of interactions between variables
	- ![[Pasted image 20230912160252.png|800]]
		- This study measures impact of cellphone use **and** traffic density on stopping time
### Types of Experimental Designs
- **Between groups** (or between subjects) design
	- Each group (experimental or control) is made up of a different group of people
	- ![[Pasted image 20230912160020.png]]
- **Repeated measures** (or within subjects) design ^8ae0ad
	- Each participant is exposed to all possible *IV* conditions
	- ![[Pasted image 20230912160044.png]]


### Statistics
Using math to deal with data
- **Descriptive statistics:** organizing and summarizing data in a useful way
- **Inferential statistics:** interpreting data and drawing conclusions
#### Making judgements with data
- **Null Hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>):** there is no relationship between the variables of interest in the population
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H<sub>A</sub>):** there is a relationship between the variables of interest in the population
- **5% Rule:** If probability of event is less than 5% it is a rare event
- Statistical Significance: Rejecting Null hypothesis by determining if the *IV* and *DV* are clearly connected

### Pros and Cons of Experimental Research
- [p] Conclusions about cause-and-effect can be drawn
- [c] Artificial nature of experiments
- [c] Ethical and practical issues

### Do We Trust the Experimental Results? (Validity)
**Internal Validity**:
