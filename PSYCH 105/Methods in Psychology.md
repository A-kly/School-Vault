# Experience and Intuition V.S. Science
## Pitfalls of Everyday Approaches
To understand behaviour we rely on:
- Personal Experience
- Our own intuition
### Problems with experience
- No Comparison group (only our **own** experience)
- Experience can have **confounding** variables
	- experience is not controlled enough to make clear assumptions
	- eg: try a new medication and you feel better!
		- Is it the medication? Your expectations? Nicer weather?
### Problems with Intuition
-  Bias
	- Being swayed by a good story
	- Being persuaded by what easily comes to mind
	- Failing to think about what we cannot see
	- Focusing on the evidence we like best
	- Being biased about being biased
## Science: Rationalism vs Empiricism
- **Rationalism:** the idea that knowledge can be obtained through reasoning
- **Empiricism:** the idea that knowledge can be obtained through observation and experience
### How is Science Different?
- Science is probabilistic
	- More than one person being considered
- Comparison groups
	- E.g., before vs after, no treatment vs treatment
- Systematic methods to avoid confounds
	- Control for variables or measure to include them
- Techniques to avoid biases
	- E.g., single- and double-blind designs
- Science is a public affair
	- Research is published in peer-reviewed journals
# Basics of Psychological Research

## Goals of Psychological Research
1. Measurement and description
2. Understanding and prediction
3. Application and control
## Important Definitions
- **Variable:** Any characteristic that can vary
- **Operational Definition:** Defines a variable in terms of specific procedures used to produce or measure it
	- A description in concrete, measurable terms
- **Data:** measurements collected; a set of observations
- **Theory:** set of statements that describes general principles about how variables relate to one another
- **Hypothesis:** prediction about the outcomes of your research based on theory
- **Participants/Subjects:** the organisms whose behaviour is systematically observed in a study
## What makes a good theory?
- Consistent with prior observation (i.e., predictions are supported by research)
- Conforms to law of parsimony (i.e., is as simple as possible); aka Occam’s Razor
- Specific
- Measurable
- Establish causality*
- Falsifiable – something that we can actually test
## Scientific Method

## How Do We Collect Data?
- **Psychological test:** a standardized measure to obtain a sample of subjects’ behaviour
- **Physiological/neural recording:** an instrument monitors and records specific physiological processes in a subject
- **Examination of archival records:** analyze existing institutional records
# Types of Research
- [[#Descriptive Research]]
	- How common is X? When does Y occur?
- [[#Correlational Research]]
	- Are X & Y related? If X changes, how will Y change?
- [[#Experimental Research]]
	- Does X cause Y? If we manipulate X, how does Y change in response?
## Descriptive Research
- Descriptive Methods: any means to capture, report, record, or otherwise describe a group
	- Naturalistic observation, Participant observation, Case studies, Surveys
- Based on a single measured variable
- Sometimes grouped with correlational research
### Naturalistic Observation
- Observe behavior without manipulation
- Most likely representative of real world behavior
- No control over behavior
- Difficult to determine exact cause of behavior
### Participant Observation
- Researcher interacts with population of interest
- Allows for research insights from participants' perspective
- May be subject to biases or interpretation
- Observations may not be repeatable
### Case study
- A report of a single person, group, or situation
- Collect a lot of detail
- Not an experiment
- Can be difficult to draw causal relationships
- eg. Patient Henry Molaison (H.M.)
	- Hipocampus removal
### Survey
-  Questions to extract specific information from a group of people
- Relatively easy to administer
- An effective approach to gather lots of information
- Susceptible to biases from both researchers and participants
### Types of Statistics
- **Statistics:** using mathematics to organize, summarize, and interpret numerical data
	- **Descriptive statistics:** organizing and summarizing data in a useful way
	- **Inferential statistics:** interpreting data and drawing conclusions
### Describing Data
- Measures of central tendency: where is the centre of the data?
	- **Mode** – most frequent value
	- **Median** – look at total number of values, divide in half, record value given for middle data point
	- **Mean** – average; center of dataset, skewed by outliers
	- ![[Pasted image 20230907162941.png|200]]
- Variability: How spread out is the data? What is the shape of the data?
	- Range – subtract lowest from highest data value
	- Standard deviation – spread of data around mean; sqrt(variance)
	- Variance – average of squared deviation scores; (standard deviation)^2
#### THE FOLLOWING IS IMPORTANT AND ALSO CONFUSING

### Pros & Cons of Descriptive Research
- Pros:
	- Can describe variables of interest
- Cons:
	- Do not learn about relationships or causality
	- Cannot manipulate measured variables
## Correlational Research
- At least two measured variables
- Study of the relationship between two measured variables
- unlike [[#Descriptive Research]], we are not simply measuring and describing one thing
- ==Correlation =/= causation==
### Correlation
- **Correlation coefficient (r)**: describes the relationship between two variables
	- Ranges from -1.0 to +1.0
	- Sign indicates direction
	- Absolute value indicates strength
- Positive correlations
	- 0 < r ≤ +1.0
	- Increase in variable A --> **Increase** in variable B
- Negative correlations
	- -1.0 ≤ r < 0
	- Increase in variable A --> **Decrease** in variable B
- Zero Correlations
	- r=0
	- Neither Variable is dependent on another

### Advantages of Correlational Research
- Shows strength of relationships
- Make predictions
	- Past + future extrapolation
- Identifies "real world" associations
### Disadvantages of Correlational Research
- Cannot manipulate measured variables
	- eg. Studying amount vs grade result
- Can't assume cause/effect relationship
	- Only Correlation not causation
	- Shows association, **Not** cause
### Third variable problem
![[Pasted image 20230907162520.png]]
## Experimental Research
- At least one manipulated variable
- Not like [[#Descriptive Research]], Not just describing one measured variable
- Not like [[#Correlational Research]]], Not passively observing
- Experimental research involves **manipulating** one variable under controlled conditions to observe another variable change
	- Emphasis on our own manipulation
- Detects **Cause-effect relationships**
- Tests Theories, Hypotheses
### Important Variables In Experiments
