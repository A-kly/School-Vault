# Development
- **Development:** Growth and change in an organism over time
- Can include changes that are:
	- **Progressive**
		- e.g., learning to walk or talk
	- **Regressive**
		- e.g., declines in cognitive functioning with age
# Developmental Research Designs
- **[[#Cross-sectional Research Designs|Cross-sectional]]:** compare individuals of different ages at the same point in time
- **[[#Longitudinal Research Designs|Longitudinal]]:** repeatedly test the same individuals as they grow older
	- **Cohort:** group of individuals who share some trait
![[Pasted image 20231003155220.png]]
- **[[#Sequential Research Designs|Sequential ]]:** repeatedly test multiple age cohorts as they grow older

## Cross-sectional Research Designs
- Measure different ages at same time
	- 2020: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30 year-olds
- Issues:
	- Different cohorts grew up in different time periods
	- Different experiences, cultural changes, environmental changes
		- Technology; growing up in depression; access to higher education
- Benefits:
	- Quick to do and gather lots of data
![[Pasted image 20231003154346.png]] Measure all age groups at the same (current) time.
## Longitudinal Research Designs
- Test same cohort at different times
	- 2000: survey 10 year-olds
	- 2010: 20 year-olds
	- 2020: 30 year-olds
- Issues:
	- Time-consuming
	- People drop out
	- Changes generalizable to all people, just this group?
![[Pasted image 20231003154556.png]] Same group is measured repeatedly over time.

## Sequential Research Designs
- Combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
- Repeatedly test several cohorts as they grow older
	- Do they all follow similar patterns?
- Most comprehensive, but most time-consuming

- Test several cohorts as they age
	- 2000: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
	- 2010: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
	- 2020: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
- Helps avoid the issues of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
![[Pasted image 20231003155038.png]] Each group starts at a different age group. Measure each group over time. 
# Common Developmental Paradigms
- *Investigating abstract concepts*
- Working with individuals who may not be able to verbalize their experience
## Example: Studying Infant Reflexive Behavior
- **High amplitude sucking paradigm**
	- Uses sucking frequency to measure preferences
- **Habituation paradigms**
	- Novelty versus familiarity preferences
		- Familiar face is comforting and draws attention, stranger makes kid sad
	- Getting used to object/stimuli and stop responding to it
- **Violation of expectation paradigms**
# Visual Attention in Infants
- Human infant visual fixation (Bashinski et al., 1985)
- Over trials, infants fixated longer to complex rather than simple stimuli

## Another example: object permanence

# Studying Voluntary Behaviors
- **False belief paradigms**
	- Theory of mind assessments
	- *Do we understand that our thoughts, knowledge, mental processes are our own and ==NOT== shared with others?*
![[Pasted image 20231003160818.png]] This example shows a lack of Theory of mind as the boy's perspective of what others may think changes based on his knowledge.
- **Elicited imitation paradigm**
	- Behavioral test of recall memory
	- *Can we remember the actions that someone took if we have to imitate them?*
# Questionnaire Data
- Can be used alone or in conjunction with behavioral measures
- Useful tools because parents commonly know infants best
- Limited by fallible memories and possible bias
# Ethical Considerations
- Must work with Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) for study approval
- Consent from parents and assent from some children as well
- Some studies require debriefing afterwards
# Practical Considerations
-  Difficulties associated with finding participants
- Homogenous samples
- Generalizability of research findings

# Prenatal Development
1. Germinal Stage – The Zygote
	- 0-2 weeks gestation
	- Rapid cell division
2. Embryonic Stage – The Embryo
	- 2 - 2 months gestation
	- Growth of major bodily structures
3. Fetal Stage – The Fetus
	- 2 months gestation to birth
	- Refinements and finishing touches
