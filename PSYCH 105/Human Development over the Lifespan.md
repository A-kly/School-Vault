# Development
- **Development:** Growth and change in an organism over time
- Can include changes that are:
	- **Progressive**
		- e.g., learning to walk or talk
	- **Regressive**
		- e.g., declines in cognitive functioning with age
# Developmental Research Designs
- **[[#Cross-sectional Research Designs|Cross-sectional]]:** compare individuals of different ages at the same point in time
- **[[#Longitudinal Research Designs|Longitudinal]]:** repeatedly test the same individuals as they grow older
	- **Cohort:** group of individuals who share some trait

- **[[#Sequential Research Designs|Sequential ]]:** repeatedly test multiple age cohorts as they grow older

## Cross-sectional Research Designs
- Measure different ages at same time
	- 2020: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30 year-olds
- Issues:
	- Different cohorts grew up in different time periods
	- Different experiences, cultural changes, environmental changes
		- Technology; growing up in depression; access to higher education
- Benefits:
	- Quick to do and gather lots of data
![[Pasted image 20231003154346.png]] Measure all age groups at the same (current) time.
## Longitudinal Research Designs
- Test same cohort at different times
	- 2000: survey 10 year-olds
	- 2010: 20 year-olds
	- 2020: 30 year-olds
- Issues:
	- Time-consuming
	- People drop out
	- Changes generalizable to all people, just this group?
![[Pasted image 20231003154556.png]] Same group is measured repeatedly over time.

## Sequential Research Designs
- Combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
- Repeatedly test several cohorts as they grow older
	- Do they all follow similar patterns?
- Most comprehensive, but most time-consuming

- Test several cohorts as they age
	- 2000: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
	- 2010: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
	- 2020: survey 10 year-olds, 20 year-olds, 30-year-olds
- Helps avoid the issues of both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
![[Pasted image 20231003155038.png]] Each group starts at a different age group. Measure each group over time. 
# Common Developmental Paradigms
- *Investigating abstract concepts*
- Working with individuals who may not be able to verbalize their experience
## Example: Studying Infant Reflexive Behavior
- **High amplitude sucking paradigm**
	- Uses sucking frequency to measure preferences
- **Habituation paradigms**
	- Novelty versus familiarity preferences
		- Familiar face is comforting and draws attention, stranger makes kid sad
	- Getting used to object/stimuli and stop responding to it
- **Violation of expectation paradigms**
