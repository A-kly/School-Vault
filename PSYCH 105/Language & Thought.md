# What is language?
- **Language:** grouping of spoken, written, or gestured symbols to convey info
- Case study
	- Koshik, a Korean elephant famous for his ability to “speak” up to seven Korean words
	- Imitated his caretakers
	- Rare example of cross-species “communication”
		- But is mimicking actually communication?

- Properties of language
	- Symbolic
		- Understanding concepts
	- Semantic
		- Meaning behind words
	- Generative
		- Infinite word combinations = infinite meaning generation
	- Structured
		- Order of words matters, grammar is important

# The Structure of Language
- **Phonemes:** smallest speech units
	- 100 possible, English – about 40
	- eg. "ah", "sh"
- **Morphemes:** smallest unit of meaning
	- 50,000 in English
	- Root words, prefixes, suffixes
	- eg. "non-", "un-", "do", plural "s"
- **Semantics:** meaning of words and word combinations
	- eg. 
- **Syntax:** a system of rules for arranging words into sentences
	- Different rules for different languages
	- Order of words in sentence

- **Grammar:** the systematic rules of a language
	- Includes words, tenses, and syntax
	- *Syntax + verb tenses + how to pluralize words*

## Milestones (FYI)

## Theories of Language Acquisition
### Behaviourist - Skinner’s Environmental Theory of Language
==hardcore behaviourist mindset, sounds like classical conditioning to me==
- **Language is verbal behavior**
	- **Reinforcement mediated by another person**
- Speaker is more likely to ask for something in the future when she gets what she asked for
- Speaker is less likely to say something if they are punished for saying it
- **Evidence for this theory**:
	- Specific caretaker speech patterns associated with improved word recognition in 18 month-olds
		- (Fernald & Hurtado, 2006)
	- Reduced speech rate in mothers associated with decrease in children’s stuttering
		- (Stephenson-Opsal & Bernstein, 1988)
	- Encouragement, praise, or elaboration on child’s play behavior -> reaching language milestones sooner
		- (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2001)
- **Evidence against this theory**:
	- It cannot explain the overwhelming and rapid development of human language in early childhood
		- To explain this, many claim that we are *neurologically predisposed* to develop language and that *these innate constraints primarily influence language acquisition*.
### Nativist - Chomsky’s Nativist Theory of Language
- Brains are evolved to produce language
	- Language acquisition device (LAD) (built in system to help with language learning)
- *Critical periods* for language demonstrate a biological constraint
	- *Sensitive period* may be more accurate
- Similarities across the human species regarding the process of language development
	- Children across cultures acquire nouns before verbs
	- Grammatical structure varies little between cultures
	- Default tendency of gestures
### An Emergentist Perspective (Interactionism)
==Bridges the gap between nativist and environmentalist (behavioural) approaches==

Interacts heavily with [[#Biology]] and [[#Cognition]]
#### Biology
##### Broca’s Area
**Aphasia:** inability or difficulty in producing speech
-Broca’s Patient Tan could only say “tan” after
head trauma
• Broca’s aphasia
• Mostly lower frontal lobe trauma
### Others
- Culture, language, and thought
	- Linguistic relativity
