# What is language?
- **Language:** grouping of spoken, written, or gestured symbols to convey info
- Case study
	- Koshik, a Korean elephant famous for his ability to “speak” up to seven Korean words
	- Imitated his caretakers
	- Rare example of cross-species “communication”
		- But is mimicking actually communication?

- Properties of language
	- Symbolic
		- Understanding concepts
	- Semantic
		- Meaning behind words
	- Generative
		- Infinite word combinations = infinite meaning generation
	- Structured
		- Order of words matters, grammar is important

# The Structure of Language
- **Phonemes:** smallest speech units
	- 100 possible, English – about 40
	- eg. "ah", "sh"
- **Morphemes:** smallest unit of meaning
	- 50,000 in English
	- Root words, prefixes, suffixes
	- eg. "non-", "un-", "do", plural "s"
- **Semantics:** meaning of words and word combinations
	- eg. 
- **Syntax:** a system of rules for arranging words into sentences
	- Different rules for different languages
	- Order of words in sentence

- **Grammar:** the systematic rules of a language
	- Includes words, tenses, and syntax
	- *Syntax + verb tenses + how to pluralize words*
# Language Acquisition
## Milestones (FYI)
![[Pasted image 20230914161244.png]]
## Older Theories of Language Acquisition
### Behaviourist - Skinner’s Environmental Theory of Language
==hardcore behaviourist mindset, sounds like classical conditioning to me==
- **Language is verbal behavior**
	- **Reinforcement mediated by another person**
- Speaker is more likely to ask for something in the future when she gets what she asked for
- Speaker is less likely to say something if they are punished for saying it
- **Evidence for this theory**:
	- Specific caretaker speech patterns associated with improved word recognition in 18 month-olds
		- (Fernald & Hurtado, 2006)
	- Reduced speech rate in mothers associated with decrease in children’s stuttering
		- (Stephenson-Opsal & Bernstein, 1988)
	- Encouragement, praise, or elaboration on child’s play behavior -> reaching language milestones sooner
		- (Tamis-LeMonda et al., 2001)
- **Evidence against this theory**:
	- It cannot explain the overwhelming and rapid development of human language in early childhood
		- To explain this, many claim that we are *neurologically predisposed* to develop language and that *these innate constraints primarily influence language acquisition*.
### Nativist - Chomsky’s Nativist Theory of Language
- Brains are evolved to produce language
	- Language acquisition device (LAD) (built in system to help with language learning)
- *Critical periods* for language demonstrate a biological constraint
	- *Sensitive period* may be more accurate
- Similarities across the human species regarding the process of language development
	- Children across cultures acquire nouns before verbs
	- Grammatical structure varies little between cultures
	- Default tendency of gestures
## Interactionism (An Emergentist Perspective)
==Bridges the gap between nativist and environmentalist (behavioural) approaches==
![[Pasted image 20230914163238.png|300]]
Interacts heavily with [[#Biology]] and [[#Cognition]]
### Biology
Language is localized in the brain.
#### Broca’s Area
**Aphasia:** inability or difficulty in producing speech
- Broca’s Patient Tan could only say “tan” after head trauma
	- Broca’s aphasia
- Mostly lower frontal lobe trauma
	- Near motor cortex section for mouth, vocal chords, lips
	- ![[Pasted image 20230914163854.png|400]]
	- **Involved in the production of sequential patterns in vocal and sign language**.
#### Wernicke's Area
- Wernicke’s patient could produce speech, but it was nonsense
	- Wernicke’s or fluent aphasia
- Mostly temporal lobe trauma
	- Wernicke’s area responsible for speech comprehension
	- ![[Pasted image 20230914164046.png|400]]
	- **Involved in language comprehension**.

#### Important Findings
1. There seemed to be an area of the brain controlling speech
2. Language production appeared to be controlled by the left hemisphere
3. Broca's and Wernicke's Areas are connected
![[Pasted image 20230914164228.png|400]]
### What is the purpose of language?
1. Communicate thoughts, ideas, and feelings
2. Facilitate social communication
3. Connect abstract concepts to the real world
### Cognition

#### Mental Lexicon
- storage of words and related concepts
![[Pasted image 20230919153531.png]]
Construction of lexicon reffers to [[#The Structure of Language]] as well.
![[Pasted image 20230919153643.png]]
##### Lexicon construction
![[Pasted image 20230919160206.png]]
#### Category Membership
![[Pasted image 20230919160300.png]]
- Saves processing power and mental storage compared to memorization.
	- eg, all kinds of street lights are still streetlights, the category is streetlights.

### Language, Culture, and Classification
#### Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis:
- A theory which posits the structural differences in language can alter one’s perception and understanding of reality
	- Also known as **linguistic relativity**
![[Pasted image 20230919161416.png]]
- Look at people in specific cultures and languages to see how many words they have for a certain color for blue
	- some languages only have "warm" and "cool" colors. 
- Look at ability to match sample to comparisons
	- Flash color on screen, remove color, present options
- Does accuracy relate to # of words for colors?
	- YES(???). More words to describe colors correlates to more easy perception of colors.
- Does it actually relate to word count or does it relate to practice?
	- Maybe!
# Overall cognition
## Problem Solving 
- Sequential process from initial problem state to desired end goal
- Problem solving ability influenced by:
	- nature of the problem
	- the way you approach the problem
	- past experiences
	- general knowledge
	- available strategies
![[Pasted image 20230919161936.png|400]]
### The Approach to a Problem
![[Pasted image 20230919162512.png|500]]
![[Pasted image 20230919162526.png|500]]
Problem B can solved more efficiently by using a different strategy.
#### Mental Set
- **Mental set:** expectation of how to solve a problem
	- Mental set influences how we approach a problem
	- Can lead to fixations (getting stuck with the same thought process as before)
		- Past experience or expectations can influence how we approach a problem
		- Narrows our ability to think of novel solutions
### Functional Fixedness
- **Functional fixedness:** tendency to view an object as only having one function, the one that is commonly used for, and neglecting to see other possible uses
- ![[Pasted image 20230919162815.png]]
	- eg. burn the candle without letting the wax drip
		- When items are presented in box, people do not use box as a tool
		- When items are presented outside of box, box becomes a useable tool
	- eg. a wrench is not a hammer
### Strategies
- **Algorithm:** precise set of rules applied in order to solve a problem
	- Guaranteed (mostly) to find a solution
	- eg. trying every possible number combo on a safe 
- **Trial-and-error:** apply a sequence of possible strategies until the solution is reached
	- No real order/process
	- eg. trying birthdays, important dates, etc. on a safe
- Logic problem:![[Pasted image 20230919163300.png]]
<!--SR:!2023-10-06,1,230-->

### Heuristics
- Shortcuts that we can apply to solve a problem.
	- "quick and dirty solution"
- **Means-end heuristic:** Keep the end goal in mind (goal-state) and take whatever measures necessary to attain that goal
- **Representative heuristic:** problem solver mentally comparing something to our stored prototype of an event, object, or person
	- also called *Analogical* problem solving
	- Assume something belongs to a category because it seems like the prototype
	- Beneficial because it helps us intuitively solve problems quickly
	- But can also lead to errors in problem solving
- **Availability heuristic:** Rule of thumb that we accurately estimate frequencies of events based on how difficult it is to think of them
	- eg. Most people assume sharks kill more people than vending machines
		- Due to media attention, awareness of when it happens, news, etc.
	- eg. people assume divorces are as common globally as they are in your friend group
- **Rational choice theory:** the classical view that we make decisions by determining how likely something is to happen, judging the value of the outcome, and then multiplying the two.
## Creativity
1. Preparation - become familiar with a topic
2. Incubation - taking a break from effortful problem solving
3. Illumination - insight or suddenly realizing solution to problem
4. Evaluation - decide how good your solution is
<!--SR:!2023-10-06,1,230-->

## Bias in Decision Making
- **Confirmation Bias:** Only pay attention to evidence that supports our original position
	- Ignore disconfirming evidence
- **Framing:** How you present information influences the choices people make
	- Take the sure thing for a gain frame
	- Take the chance to avoid a loss
	- eg. Framing Effect in a Game Scenario: ![[Pasted image 20230919164700.png]]
## Dual-Process Theory
### System 1
- Fast
- Heuristics
- Experience and emotions (intuition) used
- Rely on emotional centers of the brain
### System 2
- Slow
- Logical thinking
- Recruit higher order thinking areas of the brain
