# What is Intelligence?
- Originally defined as the ability to discern true or important information from false or unimportant information
- Current definition: **Intelligence:** ability to solve novel problems and learn from experience
	- Can include domains such as pattern recognition, analogous transfer, and reasoning. 
- **Self-enhancement bias:** tendency to judge one’s performance as better than the average without any evidence of special expertise or training
## Early Philosophies of Intelligence
- Aristotle distinguished between two dimensions of behavioral flexibility
	1. Practical wisdom: application of knowledge; reasoning
		- "street smart"
	2. Theoretical wisdom: understanding objective truth; science
		- "book smart"
- Detailed analysis of intelligence by Williams (1996) followed similar themes
	- Intelligence allows us to adapt to changes and learn from experience
## Early History of Intelligence Testing
- Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911)
	- Influenced by Darwin’s theory of evolution
		- Mental ability is inherited
	- *Pioneered eugenics. Very aristocracy. Lots of "no class line breaking".*
- Alfred Binet (1857–1911) and Theodore Simon (1872–1961)
	- Developed first intelligence test
		- Designed to quantifying mental ability to identify children that needed alterative education
	- Measured aptitude separately from achievement
	- *standardized test to determine program that children should be in*
- William Stern (1871–1938)
	- Developed the concept of “mental age”
	- **Ratio IQ:** divide a person’s mental age by their physical age then multiplying by 100
	- **Deviation IQ:** divide a person’s test score by the average test score of people in the same age group × 100

## Binet’s Legacy
- Lewis Terman revised Binet’s tests
	- **Stanford-Binet test**
	- WW1 used:
		- Army Alpha (verbal)
		- Army Beta (non verbal)
## Wechsler Scales
- David Wechsler
- Intelligence is set of *verbal* and *non-verbal* skills
	- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS
	- Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - WISC
	- Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - WPPSI
## Using Intelligence Test Scores?
- Intelligence test scores correlate with
	- Academic performance
	- Occupational status and job performance
	- Income ![[Pasted image 20230921160909.png]]
	- Health and longevity
	- other things ![[Pasted image 20230921160939.png]]
## The Nature of Intelligence
### Factor Analysis
- A statistical technique
- **Reduces a large number of measures to a smaller number of clusters, or factors**
- Each cluster containing variables that correlate highly with one another but less highly with variables in other clusters
- A factor allows us to infer the **underlying characteristic that presumably accounts for the links among the variables in the cluster**.

### Spearman’s Two-Factor Theory
- Charles Spearman (1863–1945)
	- Is there a hierarchy of intellectual abilities?
	- Looked for correlations between cognitive tasks and found a lot of them!

- Results from many intelligence tests best explained with a three-level hierarchy
• **General intelligence (g)** at the top
• **Middle-level abilities (m)** in the middle
	• Aka Group factors
• **Specific abilities (s)** at the bottom
### Louis Thurstone (1887–1955)
• Saw clustering of mental abilities as evidence against
g (general inteligence)
• Argued for a few stable and independent primary
