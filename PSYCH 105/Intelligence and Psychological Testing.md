# What is Intelligence?
- Originally defined as the ability to discern true or important information from false or unimportant information
- Current definition: **Intelligence:** ability to solve novel problems and learn from experience
	- Can include domains such as pattern recognition, analogous transfer, and reasoning. 
- **Self-enhancement bias:** tendency to judge one’s performance as better than the average without any evidence of special expertise or training
## Early Philosophies of Intelligence
- Aristotle distinguished between two dimensions of behavioral flexibility
	1. Practical wisdom: application of knowledge; reasoning
		- "street smart"
	2. Theoretical wisdom: understanding objective truth; science
		- "book smart"
- Detailed analysis of intelligence by Williams (1996) followed similar themes
	- Intelligence allows us to adapt to changes and learn from experience
## Early History of Intelligence Testing
- Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911)
	- Influenced by Darwin’s theory of evolution
		- Mental ability is inherited
	- *Pioneered eugenics. Very aristocracy. Lots of "no class line breaking".*
- Alfred Binet (1857–1911) and Theodore Simon (1872–1961)
	- Developed first intelligence test
		- Designed to quantifying mental ability to identify children that needed alterative education
	- Measured aptitude separately from achievement
	- *standardized test to determine program that children should be in*
- William Stern (1871–1938)
	- Developed the concept of “mental age”
	- **Ratio IQ:** divide a person’s mental age by their physical age then multiplying by 100
	- **Deviation IQ:** divide a person’s test score by the average test score of people in the same age group × 100

## Binet’s Legacy
- Lewis Terman revised Binet’s tests
	- **Stanford-Binet test**
	- WW1 used:
		- Army Alpha (verbal)
		- Army Beta (non verbal)
## Wechsler Scales
- David Wechsler
- Intelligence is set of *verbal* and *non-verbal* skills
	- Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - WAIS
	- Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - WISC
	- Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence - WPPSI
## Using Intelligence Test Scores?
- Intelligence test scores correlate with
	- Academic performance
	- Occupational status and job performance
	- Income ![[Pasted image 20230921160909.png]]
	- Health and longevity
	- other things ![[Pasted image 20230921160939.png]]
# The Nature of Intelligence
## The Flynn Effect
- Intelligence quotients seem to increase over time
- Most likely due to a combination of factors:
	1. Overall improvement in nutrition and medical care
	2. Improvements in education
	3. Increased environmental complexity via technology
## Factor Analysis
- A statistical technique
- **Reduces a large number of measures to a smaller number of clusters, or factors**
- Each cluster containing variables that correlate highly with one another but less highly with variables in other clusters
- A factor allows us to infer the **underlying characteristic that presumably accounts for the links among the variables in the cluster**.

## Spearman’s Two-Factor Theory
- Charles Spearman (1863–1945)
	- Is there a hierarchy of intellectual abilities?
	- Looked for correlations between cognitive tasks and found a lot of them!
![[Pasted image 20230921161350.png]]
- Results from many intelligence tests best explained with a three-level hierarchy
• **General intelligence (g)** at the top
• **Middle-level abilities (m)** in the middle
	• Aka Group factors
• **Specific abilities (s)** at the bottom
## Louis Thurstone (1887–1955)
- Saw clustering of mental abilities as evidence against g (general intelligence)
- Argued for a few stable and independent primary mental abilities
### Seven Primary Mental Abilities

## Combining everything
- Spearman and Thurstone were both correct
- Three-level hierarchy best describes correlations between scores on different mental ability tests
- Like Spearman’s general factor (g) and specific factors (s) and Thurstone’s group factors (m)

## Middle-Level Abilities
Two possible approaches:
- **Data-based approach**
	- Connect intelligence test scores to clusters (factor analysis)
	- *"bottom up" approach*, start with the data
- **Theory-based approach**
	- Look at human abilities that we think relate to aspects of intelligence
	- Figure out which intelligence tests measure those abilities or design new ones that can if they don’t exist
	- *"top down" approach*, start with prior assumptions/theories

### Data-Based Approach
![[Pasted image 20230921163349.png]]
- **Crystallized intelligence**
	- Apply previously learned knowledge to current problems
- **Fluid intelligence**
	- Deal with novel situations without any previous knowledge
	- See abstract relationships
	- Draw logical inferences
#### Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test
![[Pasted image 20230921163745.png]]
- Very good at avoiding cultural bias
- All about novel solutions

### Theory-Based Approach
- Robert Sternberg (1949 - ) proposed the Triarchic Theory of Intelligence
- **Analytic intelligence**
	- Ability to problem-solve; traditional intelligence test tasks
- **Creative (or synthetic) intelligence**
	- Ability to generate novel solutions using existing skills and information
- **Practical intelligence**
	- Ability to adapt to everyday settings

#### Gardner Theory Of Multiple Intelligences
- 8 relatively independent intelligences
	- Maybe 9? (existencial intelligence)
		- A philosophically oriented ability to ponder questions about the meaning of one’s existence, life, and death
