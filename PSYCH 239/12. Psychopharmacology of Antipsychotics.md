# Points to Consider:

- Antipsychotics have some of the most complicated neuropsychiatric interactions and pattern of binding to neurotransmitter receptors 
- At least 15 receptors to which antipsychotics bind and only a few are known to have an understood clinical significance but many are clinically relevant (we will discuss only 3‐4 of them) 
- Information is likely to change in the next decade, with glutamate likely to be a key neurotransmitter of clinical attention 
- Link of receptor binding to clinical action is still a HYPOTHESIS, albeit one with significant evidence to date 
- Most data to date focuses on dopamine but other neurotransmitters are also involved
# OBJECTIVES (==What the exam questions are based on==)

- Identify the two (three) major classes of antipsychotic medications 
- Understand what makes antipsychotics conventional and the relevant side effects of the first generation antipsychotics based on dopamine pathway system affected 
- Understand the major clinical and pharmacological distinctions of atypical (second generation) antipsychotics 
- Identify how the newer antipsychotics decrease the side effects associated with antipsychotic use 
- Understand the side effects associated with newer antipsychotics

		- Chlorpromazine 
		- Thioridazine

	- Olanzapine
	- Quetiapine
	- Ziprazidone
	- Paliperidone
- Third Generation Antipsychotics
	- Aripiprazole
## Functional details
- By 1970’s, antipsychotic properties were characterized by the ability of neuroleptics to block Dopamine (D2) receptors 
- Classification based on potency of binding to D2 receptors, not efficacy of medication (HIGH and LOW potency). Also divided into chemical families. 
- Positive symptom reduction (psychosis) due to blockade of D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway 
- Side effects of typical antipsychotics due to blockade of D2 receptors *throughout the brain, not just in the mesolimbic pathway*
## First Generation (typicals, “neuroleptics”)
- Chlorpromazine
	- first discovered in the 1950’s by accident (antihistamine with antipsychotic effects in schizophrenia)
- Subsequent antipsychotics discovered through their ability to produce “neurolepsis” in animal models
	- (Psychomotor slowing, emotional quieting, affective indifference)

- Easy to become enamored of a medication
- Ensure that medications are used for RELEVANT symptoms

### First Generation Antipsychotics Dopamine D2 Antagonists
![[Pasted image 20240611155304.png]]
- Effects of Dopamine Agonists and Antagonists
- Chlorpromazine blocks postsynaptic neuron activation of D2 receptor
### Side effects of First Generation Antipsychotics by system
![[Pasted image 20240611155448.png]]
1. Mesolimbic (site of Nucleus Accumbens, “pleasure centre” of the brain and part of normal reward pathway) 
	- Stimulation ‐> pleasure 
	- Blockade ‐> *apathy, anhedonia, amotivation, lack of interest in social interaction (secondary negative symptoms)*
2. Mesocortical Pathway 
	- 2a. to Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex **(DLPFC)** 
		- Secondary Negative Symptoms 
		- *Worsening of Cognitive Symptoms* 
	- 2b. To Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex **(VMPFC)** 
		- Secondary Negative Symptoms 
		- *Worsening of Emotional (Affective) Symptoms*
	- ![[Pasted image 20240611155600.png]]
3. Nigrostriatal Pathway (EPS and TD) 
	- Unaffected pathway in untreated schizophrenia 
	- Blockade of D2 receptors here causes basal ganglia movement disorders 
		- “*drug‐induced parkinsonianism*” 
		- part of extrapyramidal nervous system 
		- EPS
			- *Extrapyramidal Symptoms*
	- Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) – long‐term side effect of chronic D2 receptor blockade in this pathway with tongue, facial, and limb movement abnormalities
		- Frequently irreversible, even when antipsychotic is discontinued
	- TD thought to be due to D2 receptors “upregulating” and becoming hypersensitive to dopamine
	- 5% of patients per year on conventional antipsychotics develop TD (i.e. 25% by year 5); elderly up to 25% per year develop TD (i.e. “number needed to harm” = 4 every 5 years for young adults and 4 every year for the elderly)
	- Those developing EPS early in treatment twice as likely to develop TD
	- Risk of onset of TD decreases after 15 years of treatment (likely due to genetic protective factors)
4. Tuberoinfundibular Dopamine Pathway
	- Projects from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland
	- Unaffected in untreated schizophrenia
	- Dopamine D2 blockade elevates plasma PROLACTIN levels (hyperprolactinemia), causing galactorrhea (breast milk secretion) in men and women and amenorrhea (irregular menses) in women
***
- Conventional antipsychotics usually block some combination of (a) alpha‐1 adrenergic , (b) histamine‐1 and (c) muscarinic cholinergic receptors, accounting for their different side effect profiles
	- (a) alpha‐1 adrenergic – dizziness, drowsiness, postural hypotension 
	- (b) Histamine‐1 – weight gain, drowsiness
	- (c) muscarinic cholinergic side effects – blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, cognitive dysfunction
- In the nigrostriatal pathway, dopamine inhibits acetylcholine release, so when there is less dopamine, there is more acetylcholine, increasing likelihood of EPS. 
- Can block acetylcholine release with “anticholinergic” medications or give antipsychotic medications with anticholinergic effects to lessen EPS (but not reduce likelihood of TD)
## Second Generation Antipsychotics
- What makes an antipsychotic medication “atypical”?
	- Originally used to describe lower EPS risk associated with CLOZAPINE, 
	- Term expanded later to include greater efficacy in treating cognitive and negative symptoms, lack of prolactin elevation, greater efficacy for treatment‐resistant patients
- What makes an antipsychotic medication “atypical” pharmacologically?
	1. Rapid Dissociation from D2 receptors
		- ![[Pasted image 20240611160326.png]]
		- ![[Pasted image 20240611160347.png]]
	2. Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) Dopamine Antagonism
		- 5‐HT(1A) receptors ‐ **(+)** Increase dopamine
		- 5‐HT(2A) receptors ‐ *(-)* Decrease dopamine
		- So.... 5‐HT(2A) antagonist *increases* dopamine by disinhibiting the dopamine neuron
		- A. Reduces EPS –In the Nigrostriatal Pathway, atypicals act as a dopamine antagonists, but also the serotonin antagonism stimulates dopamine production, overcoming the effect of dopamine blockade
			- ![[Pasted image 20240611160728.png]]
				- b) normal neurons, serotonin blocks dopamine
				- c) Block dopamine receptor, dopamine can't get through
				- d) Block serotonin release, 
			- ![[Pasted image 20240611160820.png]]
			- ==REVIEW THIS!!!!==
		- B. Reduces Negative Symptoms– Increases dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex. D2 receptors are not very dense here so there is little D2 blockade. When 5HT2A is inhibited, more dopamine is produced, resulting in activation of the mesocortical pathway
			- ![[Pasted image 20240611160852.png]]
		- C. Improve positive symptoms through action on glutamate
		- D. Reduce prolactin elevation by blocking excitatory role of serotonin on prolactin production
	3. Serotonin (5‐hydroxytryptamine, 5‐HT) 1A Partial Agonism 
	4. D2 Partial Agnoism (actually THIRD GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTICS) “Goldilocks drugs” – Aripiprazole
		- Stabilizes dopamine transmission between antagonism (like typicals) and full stimulation (like dopamine)
		- Reduce D2 hyperactivity in mesolimbic dopamine neurons enough to exert antipsychotic effect without completely blocking D2 receptor but also only partially block the nigrostriatal pathway (not enough to cause EPS since a little bit of the signal still gets through)

### Side Effects of Second Generation Antipsychotics
1. Cardiometabolic risk
	- ![[Pasted image 20240611161116.png]]
	- T2DM = type 2 diabetes
	- Not simply due to increased appetite and weight gain
	- Can cause insulin resistance to develop
	- ![[Pasted image 20240611161140.png]]
2. Other risks
	- ![[Pasted image 20240611161206.png]]
	- Orthostatic hypotension, QTc prolongation (risk of cardiac arrhythmias)
	- Serious but rare events include Diabetic Ketoacidosis andNeuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
	- Schizophrenics typically have a lifespan up to a 20‐30 years shorter than average
***
- Most common side effect (CATIE study)
	- Hypersomnia/sedation
	- Common reasons for discontinuaton include weight gain, EPS, sedation
- Clozapine – unique side effect profile and monitoring requirement of frequent (up to weekly) bloodwork to monitor for agranulocytosis (low white blood cells)
