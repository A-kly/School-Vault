# Points to Consider:

- Antipsychotics have some of the most complicated neuropsychiatric interactions and pattern of binding to neurotransmitter receptors 
- At least 15 receptors to which antipsychotics bind and only a few are known to have an understood clinical significance but many are clinically relevant (we will discuss only 3‐4 of them) 
- Information is likely to change in the next decade, with glutamate likely to be a key neurotransmitter of clinical attention 
- Link of receptor binding to clinical action is still a HYPOTHESIS, albeit one with significant evidence to date 
- Most data to date focuses on dopamine but other neurotransmitters are also involved
# OBJECTIVES

- Identify the two (three) major classes of antipsychotic medications 
- Understand what makes antipsychotics conventional and the relevant side effects of the first generation antipsychotics based on dopamine pathway system affected 
- Understand the major clinical and pharmacological distinctions of atypical (second generation) antipsychotics 
- Identify how the newer antipsychotics decrease the side effects associated with antipsychotic use 
- Understand the side effects associated with newer antipsychotics
# First Generations vs. Second Generation Antipsychotics
- First Generation Antipsychotics 
	- LOW POTENCY 
		- Chlorpromazine 
		- Thioridazine
	- HIGH POTENCY 
		- Perphenazine 
		- Fluphenazine 
		- Haloperidol 
		- Pimozide
- Second Generation Antipsychotics 
	- Clozapine
	- Risperidone
	- Olanzapine
	- Quetiapine
	- Ziprazidone
	- Paliperidone
- Third Generation Antipsychotics
	- Aripiprazole
## Functional details
- By 1970’s, antipsychotic properties were characterized by the ability of neuroleptics to block Dopamine (D2) receptors 
- Classification based on potency of binding to D2 receptors, not efficacy of medication (HIGH and LOW potency). Also divided into chemical families. 
- Positive symptom reduction (psychosis) due to blockade of D2 receptors in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway 
- Side effects of typical antipsychotics due to blockade of D2 receptors throughout the brain, not just in the mesolimbic pathway

## First Generation (typicals, “neuroleptics”)
- Chlorpromazine
	- first discovered in the 1950’s by accident (antihistamine with antipsychotic effects in schizophrenia)
- Subsequent antipsychotics discovered through their ability to produce “neurolepsis” in animal models
	- (Psychomotor slowing, emotional quieting, affective indifference)

- Easy to become enamored of a medication
- Ensure that medications are used for RELEVANT symptoms
### First Generation Antipsychotics Dopamine D2 Antagonists

- Effects of Dopamine Agonists and Antagonists
### Side effects of First Generation Antipsychotics by system
![[Pasted image 20240611155448.png]]
1. Mesolimbic (site of Nucleus Accumbens, “pleasure centre” of the brain and part of normal reward pathway) 
	- Stimulation ‐> pleasure 
	- Blockade ‐> apathy, anhedonia, amotivation, lack of interest in social interaction(secondary negative symptoms)
2. Mesocortical Pathway 
	- 2a. to Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex **(DLPFC)** 
		- Secondary Negative Symptoms 
		- Worsening of Cognitive Symptoms 
	- 2b. To Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex **(VMPFC)** 
		- Secondary Negative Symptoms 
		- Worsening of Emotional (Affective) Symptoms
