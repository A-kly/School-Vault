# What are Dissociative disorders?
- Normally speaking, there is a unity to consciousness that gives rise to a sense of self.
- We perceive ourselves as progressing through space & time. 
	- A sense of continuity
- In the dissociative disorders, one or more of these aspects of daily living is disturbed.
# WHAT ARE SOMATOFORM DISORDERS?
- Somatoform disorders involve physical complaints that reflect underlying psychological conflicts or issues.

# DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS
- Always consider *malingering*… 
	- Faking illness so as to avoid or escape work or other duties, or to obtain benefits. Not a dissociative disorder. 
	- Faking amnesia is quite common. Usually an attempt to escape criminal or other responsibility.
## Dissociative Identity Disorder
- A condition in which a person has *two or more distinct or alternate personalities*.
	- Previously called Multiple Personality Disorder
### DSM-5 Criteria: DID
- A. Disruption of identity characterized by *two or more distinct personality states*, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves *marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations* in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
- B. *Recurrent gaps in the recall* of everyday events, important personal information, and/ or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
- C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.
- E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).
### DID details
- Alters may or may not be aware of each other
- “Co-conscious” or may communicate indirectly through other people or leaving notes. 
	- At other times may be in apparent conflict
- People Dx’d with DID were often highly imaginative children and suggestible adults.
- Therapeutic goal has traditionally been “reintegration” (discussed further below).
### DID Rates and History and theories
- A lot of clinicians and researchers are highly skeptical about this disorder.
	- about 21 % of Board certified psychiatrists felt there was strong evidence for the condition
	- 58% voiced skepticism and/or thought it should removed from DSM
	- Piper and Merskey (2004)
		- No proof that it results from childhood trauma as broadly believed
	- Very low base rate
	- Number of alters appears to be increasing with time
		- Seems to correspond to more movie portrayals
	- Types of alters being reported is absurd
- Spanos (2001) research
	- *Certain behaviours are differentially reinforced and a person can develop a habit of being in in multiple "roles"*
	- Almost unheard of outside North America
	- Appearance is highly influenced by cultural factors
	- A form of role-playing inadvertently cued by interviewers?
		- Eventually becomes habitual
		- Emphasizes the importance of careful interviewing.
-  Kenneth Bianchi, the so- called Hillside strangler.
	- Did the police psychiatrist who interviewed Bianchi suggest to him that he could role-play a person with multiple personalities?
	- Investigator fed Kenneth the false info of "there needs to be 3 identities" and Kenneth developed a third.
### DID vs Schizophrenia
- These two are sometimes confused by lay persons 
- Schizophrenia (Gr. split mind) refers to loosening of connections between the various psychic functions (eg., ideas, perceptions, emotions, behaviours) (left)
- DID involves the formation of separate, but (at least partly) integrated personality structures (right).

### Example
- What It's Like To Live With Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) YouTube video
	- 11 Alters (5 co-conscious)
	- “Minnie” is a 3 year old girl
	- “Devyn” is Minnie’s 26 year old caregiver
	- “Encina” says we all start off life with multiple alters 
		- Are these just different behaviours under the control of different stimuli?
## Dissociative Amnesia
- Type of dissociative disorder in which a person experiences memory losses in the absence of any identifiable organic cause. 
	- Would be retrograde except general knowledge, habits, personal tastes, and skills are usually retained. 
	- Forgotten material is usually related to trauma. 
	- May be localized *(in terms of time or place)*, selective *(Around a person or subject)* or generalized. 
	- **Specifier: With Fugue**
		- aka psychogenic fugue
		- People tend to travel and regain their normal functioning away from where they are
### DSM-5 Criteria: Dissociative Amnesia
- A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. Note: Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or selective amnesia for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. 
- B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 
- C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medical condition (e.g., partial complex seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition). 
- D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
- Specifier: 300.13 With dissociative fugue: Apparently purposeful travel or bewildered wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other important autobiographical information. 
	- Type of dissociative disorder in which one suddenly flies from one’s life situation, travels to a new location, assumes a new identity, and has amnesia for past personal material. 
	- The person usually retains skills and other abilities and may appear to others in the new environment to be leading a normal life.
## Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
- Disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization 
- Feelings of unreality or detachment from one’s self or one’s body, as if one were a robot, or functioning on automatic pilot, or observing oneself from outside 
- Patients may interpret as an “out-of-body” or transcendental experience.
***
- Depersonalization: Temporary *alteration* from usual sense of reality. Eg., Like watching oneself on TV, feeling *detached* from body or thought processes, some perceptual interference. 
- **Derealization:** Episodes of derealization are characterized by the sense that one’s surroundings have become strange or *unreal*—for example, colours may seem washed out or very bright—and time may seem to be oddly slowed down or sped up. Neither is a psychosis because contact with reality is maintained. Both can be triggered by anxiety/trauma.
- Neither is a psychosis because contact with reality is maintained. 
- Both can be triggered by anxiety/trauma.
## THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
- **Psychodynamic:** Repression
	- “splitting off” + retreat to an alternate personality 
- **Learning:** “not thinking” plus neg Rf 
	- Avoidng conscious consideration of unpleasant matter 
- **Spanos:** Role playing via observational learning
## CONTROVERSIES
- Recovered Memory
	- An ancillary issue: Claim is that some traumatic memories may be repressed but lead to depression, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms.
		- through the use of hypnosis or psychotherapy these can supposedly be recovered.
		- There is much controversy around this!
	- Repressed memories may or may not be a real phenomenon, but false memories are a reality and be “induced” in most people.
