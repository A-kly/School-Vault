# What are Dissociative disorders?
- Normally speaking, there is a unity to consciousness that gives rise to a sense of self.
- We perceive ourselves as progressing through space & time. 
	- A sense of continuity
- In the dissociative disorders, one or more of these aspects of daily living is disturbed.
# WHAT ARE SOMATOFORM DISORDERS?
- Somatoform disorders involve physical complaints that reflect underlying psychological conflicts or issues.

# DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS
- Always consider *malingering*… 
	- Faking illness so as to avoid or escape work or other duties, or to obtain benefits. Not a dissociative disorder. 
	- Faking amnesia is quite common. Usually an attempt to escape criminal or other responsibility.
## Dissociative Identity Disorder
- A condition in which a person has *two or more distinct or alternate personalities*.
	- Previously called Multiple Personality Disorder
### DSM-5 Criteria: DID
- A. Disruption of identity characterized by *two or more distinct personality states*, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves *marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations* in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
- B. *Recurrent gaps in the recall* of everyday events, important personal information, and/ or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
- C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.
- E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).
### DID details
- Alters may or may not be aware of each other
- “Co-conscious” or may communicate indirectly through other people or leaving notes. 
	- At other times may be in apparent conflict
- People Dx’d with DID were often highly imaginative children and suggestible adults.
- Therapeutic goal has traditionally been “reintegration” (discussed further below).
### DID Rates and History and theories
- A lot of clinicians and researchers are highly skeptical about this disorder.
	- about 21 % of Board certified psychiatrists felt there was strong evidence for the condition
	- 58% voiced skepticism and/or thought it should removed from DSM
	- Piper and Merskey (2004)
		- No proof that it results from childhood trauma as broadly believed
	- Very low base rate
	- Number of alters appears to be increasing with time
		- Seems to correspond to more movie portrayals
	- Types of alters being reported is absurd
- Spanos (2001) research
	- *Certain behaviours are differentially reinforced and a person can develop a habit of being in in multiple "roles"*
	- Almost unheard of outside North America
	- Appearance is highly influenced by cultural factors
	- A form of role-playing inadvertently cued by interviewers?
		- Eventually becomes habitual
		- Emphasizes the importance of careful interviewing.
-  Kenneth Bianchi, the so- called Hillside strangler.
	- Did the police psychiatrist who interviewed Bianchi suggest to him that he could role-play a person with multiple personalities?
	- Investigator fed Kenneth the false info of "there needs to be 3 identities" and Kenneth developed a third.
### DID vs Schizophrenia
- These two are sometimes confused by lay persons 
- Schizophrenia (Gr. split mind) refers to loosening of connections between the various psychic functions (eg., ideas, perceptions, emotions, behaviours) (left)
- DID involves the formation of separate, but (at least partly) integrated personality structures (right).

### Example
- What It's Like To Live With Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) YouTube video
	- 11 Alters (5 co-conscious)
	- “Minnie” is a 3 year old girl
	- “Devyn” is Minnie’s 26 year old caregiver
	- “Encina” says we all start off life with multiple alters 
		- Are these just different behaviours under the control of different stimuli?
## Dissociative Amnesia
- Type of dissociative disorder in which a person experiences memory losses in the absence of any identifiable organic cause. 
	- Would be retrograde except general knowledge, habits, personal tastes, and skills are usually retained. 
	- Forgotten material is usually related to trauma. 
	- May be localized *(in terms of time or place)*, selective *(Around a person or subject)* or generalized. 
	- **Specifier: With Fugue**
		- aka psychogenic fugue
		- People tend to travel and regain their normal functioning away from where they are
### DSM-5 Criteria: Dissociative Amnesia
- A. An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. Note: Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or selective amnesia for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. 
- B. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 
- C. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medical condition (e.g., partial complex seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition). 
- D. The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder.
- Specifier: 300.13 With dissociative fugue: Apparently purposeful travel or bewildered wandering that is associated with amnesia for identity or for other important autobiographical information. 
	- Type of dissociative disorder in which one suddenly flies from one’s life situation, travels to a new location, assumes a new identity, and has amnesia for past personal material. 
	- The person usually retains skills and other abilities and may appear to others in the new environment to be leading a normal life.
## Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder
- Disorder characterized by persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization 
- Feelings of unreality or detachment from one’s self or one’s body, as if one were a robot, or functioning on automatic pilot, or observing oneself from outside 
- Patients may interpret as an “out-of-body” or transcendental experience.
***
- Depersonalization: Temporary *alteration* from usual sense of reality. Eg., Like watching oneself on TV, feeling *detached* from body or thought processes, some perceptual interference. 
- **Derealization:** Episodes of derealization are characterized by the sense that one’s surroundings have become strange or *unreal*—for example, colours may seem washed out or very bright—and time may seem to be oddly slowed down or sped up. Neither is a psychosis because contact with reality is maintained. Both can be triggered by anxiety/trauma.
- Neither is a psychosis because contact with reality is maintained. 
- Both can be triggered by anxiety/trauma.
## THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
- **Psychodynamic:** Repression
	- “splitting off” + retreat to an alternate personality 
- **Learning:** “not thinking” plus neg Rf 
	- Avoidng conscious consideration of unpleasant matter 
- **Spanos:** Role playing via observational learning
## CONTROVERSIES
- Recovered Memory
	- An ancillary issue: Claim is that some traumatic memories may be repressed but lead to depression, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms.
		- through the use of hypnosis or psychotherapy these can supposedly be recovered.
		- There is much controversy around this!
	- Repressed memories may or may not be a real phenomenon, but false memories are a reality and be “induced” in most people.
	- Are Recovered Memories Believable? 
		- R. v. Francois 
		- Hundred of people have been charged for crimes they never committed on the basis of “recovered memories.”
	- Suggestibility & Probing 
		- False Memories can be produced in experiments 
		- 26% Porter et al (1999) 
	- True vs. False Memories
		- Constructivist nature of normal memory
## TREATMENT
- Psychoanalysis
	- Uncovering early childhood traumas 
- Cognitive Behaviour Therapy 
	- Uncovering maladaptive cognitions 
- SSRIs 
	- Non specific effects only 
	- No strong evidence that pharmacotherapy is effective with these disorders
# SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDERS
- Disorders in which people complain of physical (somatic) problems although no physical abnormality can be found.
	- eg. IBS, 
## SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDER: DSM-5 Criteria
- A. One or more *somatic symptoms* that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life. 
- B. *Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms* or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following: 
	1. Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one’s symptoms. 
	2. Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms. 
	3. Excessive time and energy devoted to these symptoms or health concerns.
-  C. Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months). 
- *Specifiers:* With predominant pain; Persistent (>6 months); Mild/Moderate/Severe
## Illness Anxiety Disorder
- The *preoccupation with the idea that one is sick* is accompanied by substantial anxiety about health and disease. Individuals with illness *anxiety* disorder are easily alarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a health- related news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course
- *Used to be hypochondriac*
### ILLNESS ANXIETY DISORDER – DSM-5 Criteria
- A. Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. 
- B. Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e.g., strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate. 
- C. There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status. 
- D. The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e.g., repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e.g., avoids doctor appointments and hospitals). (E & F Omitted) 
- Specifiers: *Care-seeking Type*; *Avoidant Type (opposite of care seeking)*
## Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)
- Type of somatic symptom disorder characterized by loss or *impairment of physical function* in the absence of any organic causes that might account for the changes.
- Formerly called hysteria or hysterical neurosis
- **La Belle Indifférence:** French term describing the *lack of concern over one’s symptoms displayed* by some people with conversion disorder but also by people with real physical disorders.
	- Coping strategy to s
### DSM-5 Criteria: Conversion Disorder
- A. One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function. 
- B. Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions. 
- C. The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder. 
- D. The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation. 
	- Symptom Specifiers: With weakness or paralysis; With abnormal movement; With swallowing symptoms; With speech symptom (e.g., dysphonia, slurred speech); With attacks or seizures; With anesthesia or sensory loss; With special sensory symptom (e.g., visual, olfactory, or hearing disturbance); With mixed symptoms 
	- With/Without Psychological Stress 
	- Acute/Persistent
#### Faking or real?
- People with conversion disorders do not consciously fake their symptoms but fear their symptoms are due to a real illness. Feeling resentful toward their own doctor, they often go “doctor shopping.”
## Factitious Disorder (Munchausen’s Syndrome)
