# DISSOCIATIVE DISORDERS
## Dissociative Identity Disorder
- A condition in which a person has *two or more distinct or alternate personalities*.
	- Previously called Multiple Personality Disorder
### DSM-5 Criteria: DID
- A. Disruption of identity characterized by *two or more distinct personality states*, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The disruption in identity involves *marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency, accompanied by related alterations* in affect, behavior, consciousness, memory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.
- B. *Recurrent gaps in the recall* of everyday events, important personal information, and/ or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.
- C. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- D. The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary playmates or other fantasy play.
- E. The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical condition (e.g., complex partial seizures).
### DID details
- Alters may or may not be aware of each other
- “Co-conscious” or may communicate indirectly through other people or leaving notes. 
	- At other times may be in apparent conflict
- People Dx’d with DID were often highly imaginative children and suggestible adults.
- Therapeutic goal has traditionally been “reintegration” (discussed further below).
### DID Rates and History and t
- A lot of clinicians and researchers are highly skeptical about this disorder.
	- about 21 % of Board certified psychiatrists felt there was strong evidence for the condition
	- 58% voiced skepticism and/or thought it should removed from DSM
	- Piper and Merskey (2004)
		- No proof that it results from childhood trauma as broadly believed
	- Very low base rate
	- Number of alters appears to be increasing with time
		- Seems to correspond to more movie portrayals
	- Types of alters being reported is absurd
- Spanos (2001) research
	- Almost unheard of outside North America
	- Appearance is highly influenced by cultural factors
	- A form of role-playing inadvertently cued by interviewers?
		- Eventually becomes habitual
		- Emphasizes the importance of careful interviewing.
-  Kenneth Bianchi, the so- called Hillside strangler.
	- Did the police psychiatrist who interviewed Bianchi suggest to him that he could role-play a person with multiple personalities?
### DID vs Schizophrenia
- These two are sometimes confused by lay persons 
- Schizophrenia (Gr. split mind) refers to loosening of connections between the various psychic functions (eg., ideas, perceptions, emotions, behaviours) (left)
- DID involves the formation of separate, but (at least partly) integrated personality structures (right).
