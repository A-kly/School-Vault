# SCHIZOPHRENIA
- Schizophrenia is among the most puzzling & disabling clinical syndromes. Schizophrenia touches every facet of an afflicted person’s life. 
- Acute episodes are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, illogical thinking, incoherent speech & bizarre behaviour. 
- Between episodes, people may still be unable to think clearly and may lack appropriate emotional responses to people & events in their lives.
# Historical Conceptions of Schizophrenia
- Emil Kraeplin (1856 – 1926). 
	- Dementia Praecox 
		- AKA Early Dementia
		- Cognitive decline
		- “the loss of inner unity of thought, feeling, and acting.” 
		- Progressive disease process 
		- Hallucinations, motoric abnormalities, delusions
- Eugen Bleuler (1857 -1939) 
	- 4 A's
		- Associations
			- Loosening in associations
		- Affect
			- Strange affects
		- Ambivalence
		- Autism
			- Withdraw socially
	- Introduced the term Schizophrenia (Sz) 
		- “split brain” 
		- Recognized variability in the course of the disorder
- Kurt Schneider (1887 – 1967) 
	- Thought the 4 As overlapped too much with other disorders and wanted better differential criteria 
	- First-rank symptoms 
		- Central to diagnosis of Sz, initially thought to be unique to Sz 
			- Some are no longer considered unique to Sz
		- ABCD 
			- Auditory hallucinations 
			- Broadcasting of thought 
				- Only in Sz
			- Controlling of thought
				- Only in Sz
				- Echo
					- Hear the thought auditorily, as a hallucination after you think it
				- Insertion
					- Others can insert thoughts into my brain
				- Withdrawal
					- Others can remove thoughts from my brain
			- Delusions 
	- Second-rank symptoms 
		- Frequently associated with Sz, but not exclusively 
			- Mood problems 
			- Non-auditory hallucinations (visual, olfactory, haptic, gustatory)
# Prevalence & Cost of Schizophrenia

- 1% of Population; fifth leading cause of disability.
	- Psychotic behaviour due to drugs is not included in this number
- Social isolation
	- Strong tendency to withdraw from society and family (due to paranoid delusions)
- Early adult onset, few cases spontaneously enter remission permanently 
- Consequences can be devastating in virtually all main functional areas 
- Homelessness and victimization are common 
	- Properly treated, individuals with Sz are no more harmful than members of the general population 
	- Often suspicious of family and professionals, so avoid Tx 
	- Delusions may lead to fear that medications are poison or thought control agents 
	- Medication side effects can be nasty (more about this later) 
	- Poor compliance with social services and our reach workers make permanency planning difficult 
	- May be reluctant to allows others into their residence to assess safety of home environment 
	- About 20 x as likely as members of general population to complete suicide
# CLINICAL FEATURES OF SCHIZOPHRENIA 
## Phases of Schizophrenia
- Prodromal Phase 
	- Most of the negative symptoms
	- Less social interaction, more withdrawl
	- Not full experience of psychosis yet
- Acute Phase 
	- Hallucinations and delusions take place
- Residual Phase
	- Hallucinations and delusions take place less (?) , less negative symptoms
## Major Features of Schizophrenia
-  Disturbances of Thought & Speech
	- Disturbances in the Content of Thought
		- Delusions of persecution
			- Being followed
		- Delusions of being controlled
		- Delusions of grandeur
	- Other Common Forms of Delusions
		- Thought Broadcasting
		- Thought Insertion
		- Thought Withdrawal
	- Disturbances in the Form of Thought
		- Neologisms
			- Made up words that have significance to the person, may have specific importance
		- Perseveration
			- Overuse of the same words
		- Clanging & Blocking
			- Clanging: Rhyming or interesting patters in words
			- Blocking: Sudden stopping of speech and resuming later sometimes on a different topic
- Attentional Deficiencies
	- Hypervigilance
- Perceptual Disturbances
	- Auditory Hallucinations & Self-Talk
		- Auditory Hallucinations in 60% of cases
		- Command Hallucinations
			- Auditory hallucinations that command the person to do something
	- Causes of Hallucinations
- Emotional Disturbances
	- Flatness of affect
	- Inappropriate affect
	- Often in facial expression
- Other Types of Impairment
	- Identity
	- Lack of ego boundaries
		- May feel unity with other things that are not them
			- God, the ocean, etc.
## Previous Subtypes of Schizophrenia (NOT in DSM-5)
- Disorganized 
	- Sometimes called Hebephrenic
- Catatonic 
	- Waxy flexibility
		- Can move them and stay in that position
	- Rigid
		- Lots of resistance and muscle tension
- Paranoid 
- Undifferentiated

## Type I vs. Type II Schizophrenia – alternate conceptualization (Crow, 1980)
- Positive symptoms & Negative symptoms
- Premorbid Functioning: Poorer in Type II
- Type 1:
	- Excessively sensitive dopamine receptors as theory
	- Good response to meds
- Type 2:
	- Increased ventricle size
	- Bad response to meds
	- Structural changes = lower cognitive function possibly
## DSM-5 Criteria: Schizophrenia 
- A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1 -month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1 ), (2), or (3):
	1. *Delusions* 
	2. *Hallucinations* 
	3. *Disorganized speech* (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence) 
	4. *Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior* 
	5. *Negative symptoms* (i.e., diminished emotional expression or avolition)
- B. For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning).
- C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6- month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
- D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1 ) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
- E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
- F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).
- Specifiers:
	- First episode, currently in acute episode
	- First episode, currently in partial
	- Multiple episodes, currently in acute episode
	- Multiple episodes, currently in full remission
	- Continuous
	- Unspecified
	- With catatonia
