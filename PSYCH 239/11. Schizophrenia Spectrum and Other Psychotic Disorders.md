# SCHIZOPHRENIA
- Schizophrenia is among the most puzzling & disabling clinical syndromes. Schizophrenia touches every facet of an afflicted person’s life. 
- Acute episodes are characterized by delusions, hallucinations, illogical thinking, incoherent speech & bizarre behaviour. 
- Between episodes, people may still be unable to think clearly and may lack appropriate emotional responses to people & events in their lives.
# Historical Conceptions of Schizophrenia
- Emil Kraeplin (1856 – 1926). 
	- Dementia Praecox 
		- AKA Early Dementia
		- Cognitive decline
		- “the loss of inner unity of thought, feeling, and acting.” 
		- Progressive disease process 
		- Hallucinations, motoric abnormalities, delusions
- Eugen Bleuler (1857 -1939) 
	- 4 A's
		- Associations
			- Loosening in associations
		- Affect
			- Strange affects
		- Ambivalence
		- Autism
			- Withdraw socially
	- Introduced the term Schizophrenia (Sz) 
		- “split brain” 
		- Recognized variability in the course of the disorder
- Kurt Schneider (1887 – 1967) 
	- Thought the 4 As overlapped too much with other disorders and wanted better differential criteria 
	- First-rank symptoms 
		- Central to diagnosis of Sz, initially thought to be unique to Sz 
			- Some are no longer considered unique to Sz
		- ABCD 
			- Auditory hallucinations 
			- Broadcasting of thought 
				- Only in Sz
			- Controlling of thought
				- Only in Sz
				- Echo
					- Hear the thought auditorily, as a hallucination after you think it
				- Insertion
					- Others can insert thoughts into my brain
				- Withdrawal
					- Others can remove thoughts from my brain
			- Delusions 
	- Second-rank symptoms 
		- Frequently associated with Sz, but not exclusively 
			- Mood problems 
			- Non-auditory hallucinations (visual, olfactory, haptic, gustatory)
# Prevalence & Cost of Schizophrenia

- 1% of Population; fifth leading cause of disability.
	- Psychotic behaviour due to drugs is not included in this number
- Social isolation
	- Strong tendency to withdraw from society and family (due to paranoid delusions)
- Early adult onset, few cases spontaneously enter remission permanently 
- Consequences can be devastating in virtually all main functional areas 
- Homelessness and victimization are common 
	- Properly treated, individuals with Sz are no more harmful than members of the general population 
	- Often suspicious of family and professionals, so avoid Tx 
	- Delusions may lead to fear that medications are poison or thought control agents 
	- Medication side effects can be nasty (more about this later) 
	- Poor compliance with social services and our reach workers make permanency planning difficult 
	- May be reluctant to allows others into their residence to assess safety of home environment 
	- About 20 x as likely as members of general population to complete suicide
