# TYPES OF MOOD DISORDERS
- Mood Episodes
- Depressive Disorders
- Bipolar Disorders
- Other Mood Disorders
- Continuum, like a thermometer
	- ![[Pasted image 20240521131428.png|300]]
	- Hypomania does not usually have to be hospitalized, neither does mild to moderate depression (DYSTHYMIA)
# Major depressive disorder (MDD)
- Characterized by major depressive episodes in the absence of manic episodes
- Characterized by a range of features:
	- depressed mood
	- lack of interest or pleasure in usual activities
	- lack of energy or motivation
	- changes in appetite or sleep patterns.
## DSM-5 Criteria
- 5 of the following symptoms present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, At least one of the symptoms is either **depressed mood** or **loss of interest or pleasure**
	1. *Depressed mood most of the day*, nearly every day, as indicated either by subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful)
	2. *Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in* all, or almost all, *activities* most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated either by subjective account or observation made by others)
	3. *Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain* (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day
	4. *Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day*
	5. *Psychomotor agitation or retardation* nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down)
	6. *Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day*
	7. *Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt* (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick)
	8. *Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness*, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others)
	9. *Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation* without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicide
## When are changes in mood considered abnormal?
- Persistent or severe changes in mood or cycles of extreme elation and depression may suggest the presence of a mood disorder.
## Rates
- Depressive disorders are MOST common in adolescence and early adulthood (15-24 years of age) 
- Through adolescence and adulthood (15-64 years of age) WOMEN have a higher prevalence of depressive disorders compared to men 
- Older adults (65 and older) have the lowest prevalence of depressive disorders, and no significant difference between men and women
## Major depressive disorder Specifiers
- With anxious distress
- With mixed features
- With melancholic features
- With atypical features
- With mood-congruent psychotic features
	- Adds to the person's sense of misery, likely voices
- With mood-incongruent psychotic features
	- Voices trying to cheer them up
- With catatonia
- With peripartum onset
	- Peripartum = around pregnancy
- With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only)
	- Correlates with limited sunlight
	- Workplace accommodations can be an office with a window
## Risk factors
- Age – more often starts in younger adulthood
	- 20s and 30s
- Socioeconomic status
- Marital status
	- Single men are worse, men worse at reaching for support
- Women are nearly twice as likely as men to develop major depression
	- Less pronounced difference in later years
	- Greater array of life stressors?
- Coping styles
## SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER
Called *MDD with seasonal pattern*
- Fatigue
- excessive sleep
- craving for carbohydrates
- weight gain
***
- affects women more often than men
- is most common among young adults
- possibly occurs in children but not as commonly as in young adults
## POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Called *MDD with Peripartum onset*
- Persistent and severe mood changes that occur following childbirth.
- In fact, about half begin in the late stages of pregnancy (hence the switch to peripartum)
- Prevalence: 10 to 15%
- AHS has gotten better at recognizing and treating it
# PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (DYSTHYMIA)
- Previously called Dysthymic Disorder
- a milder form of depression, seems to follow a chronic course of development that often begins in childhood or adolescence
- Diagnostic criteria virtually identical to MDD
- Must have been present for at least 2 years 
## DSM-5 criteria
- A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than
not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation
by others, for at least 2 years. Note: In children and
adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at
least 1 year.
- B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following:
	1. Poor appetite or overeating. 
	2. Insomnia or hypersomnia. 
	3. Low energy or fatigue. 
	4. Low self-esteem. 
	5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions. 
	6. Feelings of hopelessness.
- C. During the 2-year period (1 year for children or
adolescents) of the disturbance, the individual has never
been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than
2 months at a time.
# Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is characterized by mood *changes that revolve around a woman’s menstrual cycle*.
- A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week post menses.
- B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:
	1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings: feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection).
	2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts. 
	3. Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts. 
	4. Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge.
- C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present, to reach a total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B above.
	1. Decreased interest in usual activities (e.g., work, school, friends, hobbies). 
	2. **Subjective difficulty in concentration.**
	3. Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy. 
	4. Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings. 
	5. Hypersomnia or insomnia. 
	6. A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control. 
	7. Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.
# Bipolar disorder
![[Pasted image 20240521134736.png]]
- **Bipolar Disorder I:** features states of extreme elation (manic episodes); major depressive episodes are a common feature.
	- Full manic to full depressive range
- **Bipolar Disorder II:** features states of abnormally elevated mood (hypomania) and major depressive episodes.
	- Hypomanic range, full depressive range
- **MANIC EPISODE:** Periods of unrealistically heightened euphoria, extreme restlessness, and excessive activity characterized by disorganized behaviour and impaired judgment.
- **PRESSURED SPEECH:** Outpouring of speech in which words seem to surge urgently for expression, as in a manic state.
- **RAPID FLIGHT OF IDEAS:** A characteristic of manic behaviour involving rapid speech and changes of topics.
## Manic episode DSM-5 Criteria
==Almost invariably the case that they will have a depressive episode, We do not need to see a depressive episode for a diagnosis==
- A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy, lasting at least 1 week and present most of the day, nearly every day (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary).
- B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy or activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms (four if the mood is only irritable) are present to a significant degree and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior:
	1. *Inflated self-esteem* or grandiosity.
	2. *Decreased need for sleep* (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.
	3. *Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing*.
	4. *Distractibility* (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed.
	5. *Increase in goal-directed activity* (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation (i.e., purposeless non-goal-directed activity).
	6. *Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences* (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
## BIPOLAR I DISORDER DSM-5 CRITERIA
- A. Criteria have been met for at least one manic episode.
- B. The occurrence of the manic and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
	- So really, Dx of a Manic Episode is usually tantamount to a Bipolar I Dx
## HYPOMANIC EPISODE DSM-5 Criteria
- A. A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least 4 consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day. 
- B. During the period of mood disturbance and increased energy and activity, three (or more) of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable), represent a noticeable change from usual behavior, and have been present to a significant degree:
	1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 
	2. Decreased need for sleep (e.g., feels rested after only 3 hours of sleep). 
	3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 
	4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 
	5. Distractibility (i.e., attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli), as reported or observed. 
	6. Increase in goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually) or psychomotor agitation. 
	7. Excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments).
- C. The episode is associated with an unequivocal change in functioning that is uncharacteristic of the individual when not symptomatic.
- D. The disturbance in mood and the change in functioning are *observable by others*.
- E. **NOT severe enough to require hospitalization or cause major disruption**.
## BIPOLAR II DISORDER DSM-5 Criteria
- A. Criteria have been met for at *least one hypomanic episode* and *at least one major depressive episode* (Criteria A-C under “Major Depressive Episode” above). 
- B. There has **never been a manic episode**. 
- C. The occurrence of the hypomanic episode(s) and major depressive episode(s) is not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. 
- D. The symptoms of depression or the unpredictability caused by frequent alternation between periods of depression and hypomania causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
# CYCLOTHYMIC DISORDER
 - Mood disorder characterized by a chronic pattern of mild mood swings between depression and mania that are not of sufficient severity to be classified as bipolar disorder.
 - **Like bipolar type 1 but with a more narrow range**
	 - hypomanic to dysphoric
***
- Numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms for *at least two years* that fail to meet the criteria for hypomanic episodes. 
- Numerous periods of depressive symptoms that fail to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. 
- The person has experienced the periods mentioned above for at least half the time, and the person has not been without symptoms for longer than two months. 
- The symptoms experienced are not due to another mental health condition. 
- The symptoms experienced are not caused by a medical condition or substance. 
- The symptoms experienced impair the person's ability to socialize, work, or function in other areas of his or her life.
# THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
- Stress & Mood Disorders
	- Strong correlation
	- Even childhood experiences can later emerge as risk factors.
	- Symptoms of depression may lead to interpersonal conflict and job loss = more stress.
		- Can cause alienating behaviours
		- Spouse reactions can be a reduced amount of support, loss of energy
- Strong social supports and healthy coping style can be protective factors.
## Psychodynamic Perspective
- Anger at an internalized (introjected) love object is *inwardly directed*.
	- “I feel like I lost a part of myself…”
- Mourning (uncomplicated) is healthy and represents a form of psychological separation.
	- Not healthy if they don't feel bad for a loved one dying
- Becomes *pathological* as a result of ambivalence (i.e., anger and guilt).
	- Person does not want to let go of bad feelings (anger, guilt) it's bad
- Chronically depressed patients appear to engage in excessive self-focusing following loss or failure, but so do other clinical groups.
	- Rather than focussing on loss, we focus on our own mistakes
## Humanistic Perspective
- *What happens when we lose our sense of direction?* 
	- According to the humanistic- existential perspective, depression may result from the inability to find meaning and purpose in one’s life.
	- A "loss" may be considered lacking the chance to become who we want to be
## Learning Perspective
- Reinforcement & Depression
- Learned helplessness
- Interactional Theory (James Coyne, 1999)
	- Reciprocal interaction
### SELIGMAN’S LEARNED HELPLESSNESS EXPERIMENTS
- Training phase: 3 groups
	1. No shocks
	2. Avoidable shock
	3. Non-avoidable shock
- Test Phase: All in shuttle Box (left)
	- Groups 1 & 2: Learned avoidance
	- Group 3: Failed to learn avoidance response
- Affective and behavioural differences
- Clinical implications?

## Biological Perspective
- Genetic Factors
	- Confounding factor can be rearing/shared environment
	- Most mood disorders, especially bipolar, are highly genetically linked
- Biochemical Factors & Brain Abnormalities in Depression
	- Lithium tends to stabilize mood
