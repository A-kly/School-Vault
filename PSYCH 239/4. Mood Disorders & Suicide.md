	- ![[Pasted image 20240521131428.png|300]]
	- Hypomania does not usually have to be hospitalized, neither does mild to moderate depression (DYSTHYMIA)
# Major depressive disorder (MDD)
- Characterized by major depressive episodes in the absence of manic episodes
- Characterized by a range of features:
	- depressed mood
	- lack of interest or pleasure in usual activities
	- lack of energy or motivation
	- changes in appetite or sleep patterns.
## DSM-5 Criteria
- 5 of the following symptoms present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, At least one of the symptoms is either **depressed mood** or **loss of interest or pleasure**
	1. *Depressed mood most of the day*, nearly every day, as indicated either by subjective report (e.g., feels sad or empty) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful)
	2. *Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in* all, or almost all, *activities* most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated either by subjective account or observation made by others)
	3. *Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain* (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day
	4. *Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day*

	9. *Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation* without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or specific plan for committing suicide
## When are changes in mood considered abnormal?
- Persistent or severe changes in mood or cycles of extreme elation and depression may suggest the presence of a mood disorder.
## Rates
- Depressive disorders are MOST common in adolescence and early adulthood (15-24 years of age) 
- Through adolescence and adulthood (15-64 years of age) WOMEN have a higher prevalence of depressive disorders compared to men 
- Older adults (65 and older) have the lowest prevalence of depressive disorders, and no significant difference between men and women
## Major depressive disorder Specifiers
- With anxious distress
- With mixed features
- With melancholic features
- With atypical features
- With mood-congruent psychotic features
	- Adds to the person's sense of misery, likely voices
- With mood-incongruent psychotic features
	- Voices trying to cheer them up
- With catatonia
- With peripartum onset
	- Peripartum = around pregnancy
- With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only)
	- Correlates with limited sunlight
	- Workplace accommodations can be an office with a window
## Risk factors
- Age – more often starts in younger adulthood
	- 20s and 30s
- Socioeconomic status
- Marital status
	- Single men are worse, men worse at reaching for support
- Women are nearly twice as likely as men to develop major depression
	- Less pronounced difference in later years
	- Greater array of life stressors?
- Coping styles
## SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER
Called *MDD with seasonal pattern*
- Fatigue
- excessive sleep
- craving for carbohydrates
- weight gain
***
- affects women more often than men
- is most common among young adults
- possibly occurs in children but not as commonly as in young adults
## POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Called *MDD with Peripartum onset*
- Persistent and severe mood changes that occur following childbirth.
- In fact, about half begin in the late stages of pregnancy (hence the switch to peripartum)
- Prevalence: 10 to 15%
- AHS has gotten better at recognizing and treating it
# PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (DYSTHYMIA)
- Previously called Dysthymic Disorder
- a milder form of depression, seems to follow a chronic course of development that often begins in childhood or adolescence
- Diagnostic criteria virtually identical to MDD
- Must have been present for at least 2 years 
## DSM-5 criteria
- A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than
not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation
by others, for at least 2 years. Note: In children and
adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at

# Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder
Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder is characterized by mood *changes that revolve around a woman’s menstrual cycle*.
- A. In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week post menses.
- B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:
	1. Marked affective lability (e.g., mood swings: feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection).
	2. Marked irritability or anger or increased interpersonal conflicts.
