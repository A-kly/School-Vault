## When are changes in mood considered abnormal?
- Persistent or severe changes in mood or cycles of extreme elation and depression may suggest the presence of a mood disorder.
## Rates
- Depressive disorders are MOST common in adolescence and early adulthood (15-24 years of age) 
- Through adolescence and adulthood (15-64 years of age) WOMEN have a higher prevalence of depressive disorders compared to men 
- Older adults (65 and older) have the lowest prevalence of depressive disorders, and no significant difference between men and women
## Major depressive disorder Specifiers
- With anxious distress
- With mixed features

## POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION
Called *MDD with Peripartum onset*
- Persistent and severe mood changes that occur following childbirth.
- In fact, about half begin in the late stages of pregnancy (hence the switch to peripartum)
- Prevalence: 10 to 15%
- AHS has gotten better at recognizing and treating it
# PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (DYSTHYMIA)
- Previously called Dysthymic Disorder
- a milder form of depression, seems to follow a chronic course of development that often begins in childhood or adolescence
