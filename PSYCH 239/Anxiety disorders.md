# Anxiety
- General state of apprehension or foreboding
	- **Adaptive** when it prompts us to seek medical attention, to study for an upcoming test, or avoid danger

#  DSM-5/TR Criteria - Panic Attack
- Building block of panic disorder
- **Polythetic diagnosis** : different ways to reach a diagnosis
- A discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which **four** or more of the symptoms develop abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:
	1. Palpitations, pounding hear, or higher heart rate
	2. sweating
	3. trembling/shaking
	4. shortness of breath, or smothering
	5. feeling of chocking
	6. chest pain or discomfort
	7. nausea or abdominal distress
	8. dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint
	9. derealization or depersonalization
	10. fear of losing control or going crazy
	11. fear of dying
	12. paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)
	13. chills or hot flushes
- Situationally bound vs Situationally predisposed
	- **bound:** *only* occurs in certain conditions
	- **predisposed**: *more likely* to occur in certain conditions
#  DSM-5/TR Criteria - Panic Disorder
- *Recurrent unexpected panic attacks* **and** *at least one of the attacks has been followed by one month (or more) of one (or more) of the following*:
	1. Persistent concern about having additional attacks
	2. worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences
		1. e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going crazy") 
	3. a significant change in behavior related to the attacks

- 1 – 5% prevalence (lifetime)
- Anxiety sensitivity
	- Beliefs that anxiety symptoms are dangerous to the person
	- cause of more anxiety
# Agoraphobia
- (Fear of the marketplace)
- Accompanies panic attacks in a large minority of cases (30-50%, other writers report up to 75%)
	- When it does, it is usually fear of another attack that is most debilitating
	- makes treatment less likely unless patient gets very strong support to attend or the psychologist makes house calls
- Even without Agoraphobia, panic disordered patients are often reluctant to discuss episodes for fear of triggering another attack
	- Almost like victim of violence who refuses to report to police
# Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- General feelings of dread, foreboding, and hightened states of sympathetic arousal
	- Not linked to any one particular fear or trigger
	- Formerly referred to as free-floating anxiety
		- Freudian term
## DSM-5/TR Criteria - Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- At least 6 moths of "excessive anxiety and worry" abut a variety of issues. Generally "excessive" means more than would be expected.
- There is significant difficulty controlling anxiety or worry. If someone has a very difficult struggle to regain control, relax, or cope with the anxiety and worry, then this requirement is met.
	- Telling them not to worry is often not enough to help
- The presence for most days over the previous six months of 3 or more (only 1 for children) of the following symptoms: 
	1. Feeling wound-up, tense, or restless 
	2. Easily becoming fatigued or worn-out 
	3. Concentration problems 
	4. Irritability 
	5. Significant tension in muscles 
	6. Difficulty with sleep
# Phobic disorders
- Specific phobia
	- eg, claustrophobia
- Social phobia
- Agoraphobia
## Specific phobias
- 5 diagnostic subtypes
	1. Animal
	2. natural environment
	3. blood-injection-injury
	4. situational type
	5. other types (e.g., phobias of choking or contracting an illness).
- Strong relationship between age and the types of phobia one is likely to develop
	- Young children: animals
	- Teenagers: social
	- Adults: Agora or social phobia
### DSM-5/TR Criteria - Specific phobias
1. Marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, caused by anticipation of object or event
2. Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally pre disposed panic attack. Note: in children, the anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing or clinging.
3. The person recognizes that the fear is excessive and unreasonable. Note: in children this feature may be absent.
4. The phobic situation is avoided or is endured with intense anxiety or distress. 
5. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with a person’s routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships or there is a marked distress about having the phobia. 
6. In individuals under the age of 18 years the duration is at least 6 months.
