# Objectives
- Describes major classes of anxiety disorders and differentiate them
	- **Differential diagnosis**: differentiate between conditions based on signs and symptoms
- Recognize the key DSM-5/TR diagnostic criteria for panic attacks, panic disorder, and GAD.
- Describe the essential features of phobias, PTSD, ASD (acute stress disorder) and OCD
- Discuss the main theoretical perspectives and treatment approaches of each of the above
# Anxiety
- General state of apprehension or foreboding
	- **Adaptive** when it prompts us to seek medical attention, to study for an upcoming test, or avoid danger
	- **Maladaptive** when out is out of proportion to the level of threat or when it occurs out of the blue, not in response to environmental changes
- Common: most people experience it in varying degrees.
# Anxiety disorder features
- Physical:
	- jumpiness
	- jitters
	- increased heart rate
	- chrtness of breath
	- dizziness
	- nausea
- Behavioural
	- need to escape/ avoid situation
	- agitation
	- clinginess
	- need for reassurance
- Cognitive
	- prolonged, extra worrying
	- overly aware of bodily sensations
	- jumbled thoughts
	- nagging thoughts'
# Major types
- Panic Disorders
	- Agoraphobia
	- no agoraphobia
- Agoraphobia without history of panic disorder
- Specific phobia
- Social phobia
- Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
- Acute Stress Disorder
- Most are more common in females than males.
	- No details on gender identity vs chromosomal sex
## Two others in DSM-5-TR
- Anxiety due to general medical condition
- Substance-Induced Anxiety Disorder
- Anxiety disorder Not otherwise specified (NOS)

#  DSM-5/TR Criteria - Panic Attack
- Building block of panic disorder
- **Polythetic diagnosis** : different ways to reach a diagnosis
- A discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which **four** or more of the symptoms develop abruptly and reached a peak within 10 minutes:
	1. Palpitations, pounding hear, or higher heart rate
	2. sweating
	3. trembling/shaking
	4. shortness of breath, or smothering
	5. feeling of chocking
	6. chest pain or discomfort
	7. nausea or abdominal distress
	8. dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint
	9. derealization or depersonalization
	10. fear of losing control or going crazy
	11. fear of dying
	12. paresthesia (numbness or tingling sensations)
	13. chills or hot flushes
- Situationally bound vs Situationally predisposed
	- **bound:** *only* occurs in certain conditions
	- **predisposed**: *more likely* to occur in certain conditions
#  DSM-5/TR Criteria - Panic Disorder
- *Recurrent unexpected panic attacks* **and** *at least one of the attacks has been followed by one month (or more) of one (or more) of the following*:
	1. Persistent concern about having additional attacks
	2. worry about the implications of the attack or its consequences
		1. e.g., losing control, having a heart attack, "going crazy") 
	3. a significant change in behavior related to the attacks

- 1 – 5% prevalence (lifetime)
- Anxiety sensitivity
	- Beliefs that anxiety symptoms are dangerous to the person
	- cause of more anxiety
# Agoraphobia
- (Fear of the marketplace)
- Accompanies panic attacks in a large minority of cases (30-50%, other writers report up to 75%)
	- When it does, it is usually fear of another attack that is most debilitating
	- makes treatment less likely unless patient gets very strong support to attend or the psychologist makes house calls
- Even without Agoraphobia, panic disordered patients are often reluctant to discuss episodes for fear of triggering another attack
	- Almost like victim of violence who refuses to report to police
# Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- General feelings of dread, foreboding, and hightened states of sympathetic arousal
	- Not linked to any one particular fear or trigger
	- Formerly referred to as free-floating anxiety
		- Freudian term
## DSM-5/TR Criteria - Generalized Anxiety Disorder
- At least 6 moths of "excessive anxiety and worry" abut a variety of issues. Generally "excessive" means more than would be expected.
- There is significant difficulty controlling anxiety or worry. If someone has a very difficult struggle to regain control, relax, or cope with the anxiety and worry, then this requirement is met.
	- Telling them not to worry is often not enough to help
- The presence for most days over the previous six months of 3 or more (only 1 for children) of the following symptoms: 
	1. Feeling wound-up, tense, or restless 
	2. Easily becoming fatigued or worn-out 
	3. Concentration problems 
	4. Irritability 
	5. Significant tension in muscles 
	6. Difficulty with sleep
# Phobic disorders
- Specific phobia
	- eg, claustrophobia
- Social phobia
- Agoraphobia
## Specific phobias
- 5 diagnostic subtypes
	1. Animal
	2. natural environment
	3. blood-injection-injury
	4. situational type
	5. other types (e.g., phobias of choking or contracting an illness).
- Strong relationship between age and the types of phobia one is likely to develop
	- Young children: animals
	- Teenagers: social
	- Adults: Agora or social phobia
### DSM-5/TR Criteria - Specific phobias
1. Marked and persistent fear that is excessive or unreasonable, caused by anticipation of object or event
2. Exposure to the phobic stimulus almost invariably provokes an immediate anxiety response, which may take the form of a situationally bound or situationally pre disposed panic attack. Note: in children, the anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing or clinging.
3. The person recognizes that the fear is excessive and unreasonable. Note: in children this feature may be absent.
4. The phobic situation is avoided or is endured with intense anxiety or distress. 
5. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with a person’s routine, occupational (or academic) functioning, or social activities or relationships or there is a marked distress about having the phobia. 
6. In individuals under the age of 18 years the duration is at least 6 months.
# Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
- Obsession:
	- Intrusive, unwanted, and recurrent thought, image, or urge that seems beyond a person's ability to control
- Compulsion:
	- A repetitive behaviour or mental act that a person feels compelled or driven to perform
		- Anxiety inducing if it does not get performed
		- may perpetuate anxiety
![[Pasted image 20240514161148.png]]
- All of these must be distinguished from adjustment disorders
	- Maladaptive reactions to an identified stressor or stressor that occur shortly following exposure to the stressor and results in impaired functioning or emotional distress more than normal
	- Reactions may be resolved when stressor is removed
# Features of Traumatic Stress Reactions
- Extreme anxiety or dissociation (detachment from one's self or one's environement)
- Intrusive memories & flashbacks (chronic re-experiencing, extremely vivid, may feel like they a re back in situation)
- High arousal and vigilance
- Difficulty concentrating
## Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)
- A traumatic stress reaction occurring in the days and weeks following exposure to a traumatic event
- Resolves after stress is removed after about a month
### Romeo Dallaire
- Head of UN peace keeping in Rwanda
- discharged because of PTSD after the 1994 mission where a bunch of people were killed
- attempted suicide but thanks to meds and therapy, can function now
## Post traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
- A Prolonged (3+ months) reaction to a traumatic event that threatened death or serious injury to one’s own or another’s physical safety.
# Theoretical perspectives
## Psychodynamic perspective
- Anxiety is sign of some unconscious conflict is approaching consciousness
	- Projection: Project cause of anxiety on another person rather than realizing it is internal
		- More likely for specific anxiety focus
	- Displacement: anxiety more likely to be generalized.
## Learning Perspective
- (Mower-Miller) Two factor model: O. Hobart Mowrer
	- Factor 1: **(Pavlovian)**
		- Man on street (CS) barely escapes being run down by bus (US) -> Fear reaction (UR)
			- now anxious when by road (CR)
	- Factor 2: **(Skinnerian)**
		- Road (Sd = Discriminative Stimulus): Walks away (Reinforcement) -> Fear reduction
			- Now can minimize fear by avoiding road
			- avoidance response
	- *VERY good explanation of Agoraphobia*
- Prepared Conditioning
	- Phobias for certain things are more common
	- eg, snakes and spiders
	- nature has conditioned us to fear them
	- natural in born tendency to fear these things
	- *Diathesis* = predisposition
- Superstition: OCD
## Cognitive Perspective
- Self-defeating or irrational belief
- Oversensitivity to threat
	- **Hostile attributional bias**: assume that people are out to get you and even if their actions are *not* caused by their malice, they are attributed to be caused by their malice
- Anxiety sensitivity
	- More likely to have anxiety due to core beliefs
- Misattributions for panic attacks
## Interactionist perspective
![[Pasted image 20240514163807.png]]
- Explains anxiety sensitivity, rough explanation of panic attack development
## Biological perspective
- Genetic factors
	- Higher concordance rates with Monozygotic twins
	- Neuroticism
		- Emotionally stable vs unstable
		- Strong genetic contribution
- Neurotransmitters
	- Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
		- Inhibitory neurotransmitter
		- Calms the CNS from anxiety symptoms
		- **MOST STRONGLY IMPLICATED IN ANXIETY DISORDERS** ==on exam==
	- Benzodiazepines
- Biological aspects of panic disorder
	- Hyperventilation - can bring about panic like symptoms
- Biological aspects of OCD
	- Higher comorbidity with other anxiety disorders
# Tying it all together
- Not all people who have traumatic events develop related phobias or anxiety but not necessarily PTSD
- Genetic predisposition to greater negative arousal or makes them more likely to panic in response to changes in bodily sensations.
![[Pasted image 20240514164603.png]]
- ACES test for childhood trauma
- Extinction opportunities
	- Presence of CS is less able to illicit a conditioned response
	- Presence of discriminative stimulus is less likely to cause a learned behaviour
# Treatment
## Psychodynamic aproach
- Free association and psychoanalysis to resolve deeper conflict
- Phobic objects are symbolic of those conflicts
## Humanistic Approaches
- Unconditional positive regard allows integration of inauthentic social presentation with authentic self
## Biological Approaches
- Antidepressants
	- SSRIs/SNRIs - *less likely to have enduring benefits than CBT*
- Benzoz not frequently used to treat anxiety
	- Highly addictive
## Cognitive Approaches
- Irrational beliefs, bolstering self-efficacy, individual meaning, regular "worry periods" (Borkevic, 1985)
## Learning-Based Approaches
