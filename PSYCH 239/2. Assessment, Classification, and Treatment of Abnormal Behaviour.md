# Objectives / Plan
- Assessment
	- *Not a value judgement of people*
	- Introduce validity and reliability
	- Overview of clinical interviewing, psychological testing, behavioural assessment, and physiological measurement.
- Classification
	- DSM, it's structure, strengths & weaknesses
- Treatment
	- Biological, cognitive behavioural, psychodynamic approaches
	- Review research into effectiveness and key factors influencing successful change in psychotherapy
- Psycholegal issues related to these
# Assessment
-  provides info about personality, behaviour and cognitive functioning
- This information helps clinicians acquire a broader understanding of their clients’ problems and recommend appropriate forms of treatment.
- *Reliability*
	- Internal consistency
		- "Beliefs" are consistent with each other
	- Temporal stability
		- "Beliefs" are stable over time
	- Interrater Reliability
		- "Beliefs" similar across testers
- *Validity*
	- Content Validity
		- How well it correlates with other things that measure the same thing?
	- Criterion Validity
		- How well does it predict things related to the thing measured?
			- eg. "does a high measure of intelligence on this test correlate well with higher grades in school?"
	- Construct Validity
		- Does it measure what it is supposed to?
## Sociocultural & Ethnic Factors in the Assessment of Abnormal Behaviour
- Assessment may be reliable and valid in one culture but not another
- Most diagnostic instruments consider culture to some degree, but most fail to provide adequate norms for different cultural and ethnic groups
- Interviewer needs to be sensitive to the effect of language on the test, especially if it is different from the subjects own language
## The Clinical Interview
- Happens after we get  and analyze patient history
- Differences in theoretical approaches
- Interview formats
	- Unstructured
		- Danger: If we have preconceived notions of the patients based on history, we can miss certain questions or ask bad questions
	- Semi-structured
		- Fixed interview format in order to gain proper coverage of psychological info
		- Can go into more details and skip certain sections
	- Structured
		- Structured Clinical interview for the DSM (SCID)
		- Contains Standardized questionnaire
			- Used to determine what diagnostic criteria is satisfied
	- Close ended questions vs open ended
		- Close: finite options
		- open: long answer basically
## Psychological Tests of Intelligence & Personality
### Intelligence Tests
- Concept of “Intelligence”
	- We need to have a common definition
- Several definitions
	- Wechsler (1975): Comprehension and adaptation
	- Terman (1916): 
		- Intelligence quotient IQ=MA/CA x 100
			- Follows a normal distribution around 100
		- Problem: Differing level of variance at different ages 
		- Solution (Wechsler): Deviation IQ scores
### Personality tests
- Self report tests (incorrectly called objective measures)
	- Questions ask about things correlated with personality types
	- Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-II)
	- Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI)
- Projective tests
	- Based on assumptions..
		- Stimulus materials are neutral and they are gonna project their own opinions and feelings on it
	- Rorschach inkblot test
		- ![[Pasted image 20240509161054.png|300]]
	- Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)
		- ![[Pasted image 20240509161112.png|300]]
	- Blacky Test
		- ==VERY FREUDIAN==
		- ![[Pasted image 20240509161138.png|300]]

## Neuropsychological Assessment
- Used to see if psychological problems are from underlying neurological damage or brain defects
- Halstead-Reitan Neuropsychological Battery
	- Most broadly used
- Luria-Nebraska Battery
## Behavioural Assessment
- Objective recording and observing a behaviour
	- Get the person to keep track of their behaviour
- Functional analysis
	- When is behaviour?
	- Consequences?
- Behavioural interview
- Reactivity
	- When you know you are being measured, the behaviour is likely to change
	- eg. Hawthorn factory thing
- Self-monitoring
	- The person keeps track themselves of the data
- Analogue Measures
	- Don't look at behaviour itself but look at analogue of behaviour
	- eg. count bottles instead of "drinks"
- Behavioural rating scales
	- Provide self report on how frequently or problematically we engage in behaviour
## Cognitive Assessment
- Involves the assessment of cognition (thoughts, beliefs and attitudes)
- Helps identify patterns of thinking and *distortions in those thoughts*
### Methods of Cognitive Assessment
- Thought Diaries
- Cognitive Checklist
- Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale
## Physiological Measures
- Examines people's physiological responses
- Galvanic skin responses (GSR)
	- How much the electrical resistance of your skin changes
	- caused by sweat
- Electroencephalograph (EEG)
	- measures brain waves
- Electromyograph (EMG)
	- How much neural stimulation is going into muscle
- Measures of sexual arousal (PPG and VPP)
## Probing the brain
- Computerized tomography (CT scan)
- Positron emission tomography (PET scans)
- MRIs
- Functional MRIs (fMRI)
- Brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM)
## Please be mindful
- Testing by itself =/= Assessment
- Propper assessment = Clinical history and observation + Measurement + Expert Knowledge + Formulation
- Strengths of the person must be considered as equally important: Can’t just focus on pathology
# How do we classify abnormal behaviour?
- Dates back to ancient times
- DSM-5
- Classification is at the core of the scientific enterprise.
- Labels make communication about psychological disorders possible
## Current systems
- DSM -5
- ICD
- CCMD
## The DSM & Models of Abnormal Behaviour
- Classifying disorders not people
- Attempt to define and discover actual diseases (mental or psychological disorders)
	- Inherently medical view
	- Most medical disorders do not qualify as **disease processes**, but they can still be illnesses
	- clinical procedures or **syndromes**
	- **Disease process** = *conditions with well understood cause and course*
	- **Syndrome** = *Collection of symptoms that appear at the same time*
### Features of the DSM
- Specific diagnostic criteria
- Abnormal behavioural patterns that share features and are grouped together
### Goals in the DSM
1. Atheoretical
	1. not tied to any one school of thought
2. Descriptive
	1. What is Observable in patient?
3. Polythetic
	1. Same condition can look subtly different
4. Good interrater reliability
	1. Agreement between clinicians
### Evaluating the DSM system
![[Pasted image 20240509164030.png]]
- High Kappa = DSM agrees with other diagnosis structures
	- Not as bad as it looks
- Has not improved much since 3rd edition
	- True values may be a lot lower actually
- Validity (construct)
	- Can be inadvertently sacrificed in the interest of maximizing reliability
	- We may distort or only look at subset of clinical features
	- realism vs instrumentalism
		- instrumentalism = reliability valued more and sacrifices validity
		- Like a camera, not an exact or 100% accurate picture, "pixelated", includes less details
- Predictive Validity
	- Diagnosis -> Disease course, treatment options, and clinical outcomes
#### SM-5 Major changes
- Dimensional Rather Than Categorical system
	- *kinda? they didn't do the best job*
- Reordered in a developmental lifespan way
- Criterion changes and replacements of DSM-IV disorders with more relevant disorders
## Sociocultural factors
- Reliability and validity assessments may be culture specific
- Disentangling psychopathology from sociocultural factors
- Issues of translation
- Culture-Bound Syndromes 
	- psychological distress that are limited to one or only a few cultures
	- Example: Tajinn-kyofu-sho (TKS) is a common disorder seen in Japan, characterized by an excessive fear that one will behave in embarrassing ways or offend other people
## Disorders in the DSM
- DSM I --->106
- DSM II --->182
- DSM III --->265
- DSM III R --->292
- DSM IV/TR --->297
- DSM 5 --->300+ (?)
- What does this tell us about our understanding of psychopathology?
	- Not much! Many options!
	- Maybe our understanding is more
	- Maybe the higher number is bad!
- What are the implications for inter-rater reliability?
	- More overlapping symptoms can fuck with reliability
# Treatment
- Mental health professionals
	- Clinical Psychologist
	- Psychiatrist
	- Social Workers
	- Psychiatric Nurses
	- Family physicians
- The above requires a professional registration (not licence) and work withing a legislatively defined scope of practice
- Bill 30 (The Mental Health Services Protection Act) received Royal Assent in December 2018.
## Methods of Treatment
- ==Most important part of therapy is the therapist-patient connection==
---
- Biological therapies
	- Medication
	- Electroconvulsive Therapy
	- Psychosurgery
	- Deep brain stimulation
		- Electrodes implanted much like a heart pacemaker
		- Effect depends on location of electrodes
- Psychodynamic Therapies
	- Free association 
	- Transference
		- Pretend therapist is parent and then get unfinished business out
	- Modern Psychodynamic Approaches
- Behaviour Therapy
	- Systematic Desensitization
	- Gradual exposure
	- Token Economies
		- Use fake money to promote good behaviour as a reward
	- Modelling
- Humanistic- Existential therapies
	- Person-centered therapy (Rogers)
	- Emotion-focused therapy (Greenberg)
- Cognitive behaviour therapies
	- Ellis' Rational Emotive therapy (RT)
	- Beck’s Cognitive Therapy
	- Meichenbaum’s Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy
---
- Eclectic **(Integrative)** therapy
	- Choosing techniques from a large variety of theories that are carefully chosen to help your patient specifically
	- **Eclectic** = grab bag therapy, *BAD*, new meaning developed over time, *Syncretism*
		- Does more damage than help
- Group, Family, and Marital Therapy
- Computer-Assisted Therapy
	- Zoom, google meets
	- Computerized clinical interviews have been used for 30+ years
	- Computers can be as skilled as clinicians at obtaining info from clients and getting accurate diagnosis, and are less expensive and more time efficient.
	- Simplest e-therapy is through email on small issues
	- Text messages and chat rooms
	- Lots of apps for CBT and self-help
- Indigenous Healing Perspective
	- Mental health is a balance of physical, mental, emotional and spiritual
	- Mental wellness is a continuum
	- Mental wellness as multileveled:
		- Individual, family, community
	- Mental heath issues are most often helped by elders
	- depend on ceremony, tradition, nature, wilderness, connection to the land
	- AHS has done some of this to help
	- Connectedness and cultural identity
# Does psychotherapy actually work?
- 375 controlled studies comparing various types of therapies
	- Average psychotherapy client in these studies was better off than 75-80% of the clients who remained untreated
- Establishing the superiority of one approach versus another is more problematic
	- Depends on lots of factors including the disorder
		- Depends also on therapist-client *aliance*
	- "Dodo bird effect"
		- Assume all forms are therapy are valid and equal
		- There is sometimes a tendency to declare outright to say that one is falling behind others
## Nonspecific factors
- Factors consistent with most therapies
- Therapeutic alliance is a necessary condition, 
	- If you don't have it, therapy will not be effective
- Factors can be:
	- Mobilization of hope
	- attention and support provided by therapist
	- development of **good working aliance**
- **Quality of the theraputic aliance is necessary for effective therapyu**
- correlation with outcome typically in range of 0.2
- Describes virtually all aspects of the relationshit between client and therapist
