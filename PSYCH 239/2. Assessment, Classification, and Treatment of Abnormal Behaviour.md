# Objectives / Plan
- Assessment
	- *Not a value judgement of people*
	- Introduce validity and reliability
	- Overview of clinical interviewing, psychological testing, behavioural assessment, and physiological measurement.
- Classification
	- DSM, it's structure, strengths & weaknesses
- Treatment
	- Biological, cognitive behavioural, psychodynamic approaches
	- Review research into effectiveness and key factors influencing successful change in psychotherapy
- Psycholegal issues related to these
# Assessment
-  provides info about personality, behaviour and cognitive functioning
- This information helps clinicians acquire a broader understanding of their clients’ problems and recommend appropriate forms of treatment.
- *Reliability*
	- Internal consistency
		- "Beliefs" are consistent with each other
	- Temporal stability
		- "Beliefs" are stable over time
	- Interrater Reliability
		- "Beliefs" similar across testers
- *Validity*
	- Content Validity
		- How well it correlates with other things that measure the same thing?
	- Criterion Validity
		- How well does it predict things related to the thing measured?
			- eg. "does a high measure of intelligence on this test correlate well with higher grades in school?"
	- Construct Validity
		- Does it measure what it is supposed to?
## Sociocultural & Ethnic Factors in the Assessment of Abnormal Behaviour
- Assessment may be reliable and valid in one culture but not another
- Most diagnostic instruments consider culture to some degree, but most fail to provide adequate norms for different cultural and ethnic groups
- Interviewer needs to be sensitive to the effect of language on the test, especially if it is different from the subjects own language
## The Clinical Interview
- Happens after we get  and analyze patient history
- Differences in theoretical approaches
- Interview formats
	- Unstructured
		- Danger: If we have preconceived notions of the patients based on history, we can miss certain questions or ask bad questions
	- Semi-structured
		- Fixed interview format in order to gain proper coverage of psychological info
		- Can go into more details and skip certain sections
	- Structured
		- Structured Clinical interview for the DSM (SCID)
		- Contains Standardized questionnaire
			- Used to determine what diagnostic criteria is satisfied
	- Close ended questions vs open ended
		- Close: finite options
		- open: long answer basically
## Psychological Tests of Intelligence & Personality
### Intelligence Tests
- Concept of “Intelligence”
	- We need to have a common definition
- Several definitions
	- Wechsler (1975): Comprehension and adaptation
	- Terman (1916): 
		- Intelligence quotient IQ=MA/CA x 100
		- Problem: Differing level of variance at different ages 
		- Solution (Wechsler): Deviation IQ scores
