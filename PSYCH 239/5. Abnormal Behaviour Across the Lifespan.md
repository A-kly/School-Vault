# Objectives
- 3 sections stuck together
- Provide understanding of relationship between developmental expectations and psychopathy
- Discuss some disorders normally diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and also in the senior years
- discuss theoretical and treatment issues and how they may change as a function of age
- provide a brief overview of treatment oralities for various disorders in this section
# 3 distinct sections
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders
	- Usually evident in childhood often before grade school
- Disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders
	- Problems with behaviour and emotional regulation
- Neurocognitive Disorders
	- Disruptions in previously normal cognitive ability
# Abnormal Behaviour Across Lifespan
- Historically, children were considered mini adults with the same level of brain function
- The psychological problems experienced by children and young people are often *especially poignant in that they affect children at a time in their lives when they have relatively little ability to cope*. 
- Some problems of childhood *prevent children from reaching their potential*; others mirror the problems faced by adults.
- Finally, there are some problems unique to childhood or disorders that manifest themselves differently in children compared to adults.
- Normal vs abnormal behaviour must be considered along with developmental issues as well as ethnicity and gender and age.
- Need to consider
	- Neurodevelopmental differences
	- Learning history
	- Emotional Resilience
	- Solidification of personality
		- Personality very similar to early life personality
# Neurodevelopmental Disorders
- Intellectual Disability
- Autism Spectrum Disorders
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) – Specific Learning Disorder
- Motor Disorders
- Communication Disorder
## Historically
- Caring for ill children is a recently adopted value
	- Ancient Greece: Left to die, thrown off cliff
- Do we think this is universally awful?
	- Terminating pregnancies where fetal cells show signs of Down's Syndrome?
	- Lower surgical and medical priority for severely disabled individuals
		- Organ transplants for example
## Intellectual Disability Disorder
- Based on level of adaptive functioning, not IQ alone
	- Mild
	- Moderate
	- Severe
	- Profound
- Social adjustment can have a significant bearing on life success
	- Agreeable, kind, non aggressive = easy to find caregivers
### Causes
- Prenatal Factors 
	- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
		- Human herpes type 5
		- 90% of adults have it at age 60, neurodevelopment is done by then
	- Inadequate diet during pregnancy 
	- Maternal (while pregnant) 
		- Drinking (FASD)
			- Look at:
				- Growth impairment (below 3rd percentile in height and weight at birth)
				- look at prenatal exposure to alcohol
				- Probability of CNS damage
		- Valproate 
			- medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches
		- Smoking 
		- Antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs 
		- Heavy metals (lead, mercury)
- Cultural-Familial causes
	- Cultural-familial intellectual impairment
		- Childhood punishment practices
		- Home environment
- Intervention
	- Mainstreaming vs specialization
		- specialization: target very specific issues and work on them (special ed)
		- Mainstreaming: put them in a normal social environment and they can work on building these skills on their own (normal class)
	- Diagnostic overshadowing
		- One condition covering up other conditions
		- Hidden comorbidities can lead to other issues and make helping the person harder
#### Medical conditions
- Down Syndrome
- Fragile X Syndrome
- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Smith-Lemil-Opitz Syndrome
- Tay-Sachs disease
## Savant syndrome
- Condition where a person with a neurodevelopmental disorder can perform exceptionally in a specific domain such as mathematics.
- Savant Syndrome occurs in *0.06% of those with intellectual disability* and is **closely linked to autism** spectrum disorder. It occurs about six times more often in males than females.
## Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Involves markedly impaired behaviour or functioning in multiple areas of development.
- ASD often becomes apparent in first few years of life and is often associated with intellectual disability when it is diagnosed early.
- Larger group of ASD individuals are not considered high needs and do not have a marked intellectual disability. Would have been considered Asperger's.
- Before spectrum definition
	- L. Kanner
		- Kanner Syndrome
		- Unaffectionate children
		- More of a learned behaviour theory
	- B. Bettelheim
		- Refrigerator mothers
		- More to do with mother's behaviour
		- WRONG
### DSM-5 Criteria
- A. **Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts**, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive, see text): 
	1. *Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity*, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. 
	2. *Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction*, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication. 
	3. *Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships*, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.
- B. **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities**, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): 
	1. *Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements*, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
	2. *Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns or verbal nonverbal behavior* (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day). 
	3. *Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus* (e.g, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interest). 
	4. *Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment* (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
- C. Symptoms must be present in the **early developmental period** (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
- D. **Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning**.
- E. These disturbances are **not better explained by intellectual disability** (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.
### Theoretical Perspectives
- O. Ivar Løvaas
	- Hypothesized *inability to process more than one sensory datum at a time*.
		- Not actually inability, just difficult
	- Leads to conditioning deficits 
		- Association is difficult establish
- Simon Baron-Cohen (paternal cousin of Sasha Baron-Cohen (borat))
	- Theory of Mind
		- Autistic person does not have the ability to put themselves in the shoes of another person
		- Reduced empathy
- Neurodevelopmental Deficits
	- Evidence of structural abnormalities is inconsistent
		- Area around *Nucellus Acumens* has an early burst of growth in terms of neurological development 
### Treatment
- Intensive behavioural intervention
	- Lovass (1987) 40 hours/wk x 2 years = normal IQ scores for just under half of 19 subjects.
		- Not actually inability, just difficult to compensate
		- Practice helps a lot, intensive practice to overcome intellectual deficits
- Social simulation (eg., FaceSay)
	- Social practice for autistic people
## ADHD in the DSM-5
- A. Six or more of the following symptoms of *inattention* have been present for at least 6 months to a point that is inappropriate for developmental level: 
	- Often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities. 
	- Often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities. 
	- Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly. 
	- Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions). 
	- Often has trouble organizing activities. 
	- Often avoids, dislikes, or doesn't want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework). 
	- Often loses things needed for tasks and activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools). 
	- Is often easily distracted. 
	- Is often forgetful in daily activities.
- B. Six or more of the following symptoms of *hyperactivity- impulsivity* have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level:
	- Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat when sitting still is expected.
	- Often gets up from seat when remaining in seat is expected. 
	- Often excessively runs about or climbs when and where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may feel very restless). 
	- Often has trouble playing or doing leisure activities quietly. 
	- Is often "on the go" or often acts as if "driven by a motor". 
	- Often talks excessively. 
	- Impulsivity 
	- Often blurts out answers before questions have been finished. – Often has trouble waiting one's turn. 
	- Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).
### Types
- ADHD, Combined Type: if both criteria A and B are met for the past 6 months 
- ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type: if criterion A is met but criterion IB is not met for the past six months 
- ADHD, Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type: if Criterion B is met but Criterion A is not met for the past six months.
- Also specify level of severity based on number of signs present: 
	- Mild 
	- Moderate 
	- Severe
### Comorbidities
![[Pasted image 20240521161843.png]]
### Theoretical Perspectives
- Genetic and environmental
	- **ONE OF THE MOST HERITABLE CONDITIONS THERE IS**, especially from the father
	- Ascending reticular activating system
		- Responsible for establishing mental background noise
		- More active in introverted people and non ADHD people
		- ADHD people look for stimulation to increase this area of the brain
		- Stimulant medication helps
- Prenatal risk factors: Drinking, smoking, antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs, poor nutrition, heavy metals (lead, mercury)
### Treatment
- Stimulants 
- Behavior therapy (for motoric excesses) 
- EEG biofeedback
	- Give people feedback they otherwise wouldn't have about their own personal state
	- For ADHD, record brain electricity, beta and theta ratio, the higher the ratio the more focussed,
		- Train people to work on raising that ratio
## Specific Learning Disorders
- **Learning Disorder:** Noted deficiency in a specific learning ability in contrast to other abilities
### Dyslexia
- Impaired reading ability, difficulty with alphabet or spelling
- Problems differentiating similar looking letters (e,c,o, OR p,d,q)
- words may appear reversed or blurred
- problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding).
- Affects areas of the brain that process language
![[Pasted image 20240521163837.png|500]]
**Phonological deficits are required for dyslexia**
#### Understanding variations in dyslexia
![[Pasted image 20240521163903.png|500]]
#### Genetics & Dyslexia:
- People whose parents have dyslexia are at greater risk themselves. 
- Higher rates of dyslexia are found between identical (MZ) than fraternal (DZ) twins: 70% versus 40%. 
- Genes may play a role in causing defects in the brain circuitry involved in reading.
## Other disorders
- Impairment in mathematics
- Impairment of written expression
	- Must be diagnosed with lower than it should be writing ability but NOT speaking ability
- Impairment in reading
- **All of these cannot be diagnosed when people are not practicing, more apparent with math**
## Theoretical Perspectives
- Neurobiological
- Genetic factors
## Intervention
- Individual Education Plan
	- Specific skill instruction
		- Physical cues
		- practice and teaching
	- Accommodations
		- More exam time, smaller rooms, etc.
	- Compensatory strategies
		- Computers, dictation
	- Self-Advocacy skills
		- Teach them to be an advocate for themselves
		- Teach them to reduce embarrassment
		- Teach them to seek out opportunities and maximizing their success
# DISRUPTIVE, IMPULSE CONTROL, AND CONDUCT DISORDERS
- ODD 
- Intermittent Explosive Disorder 
- Conduct Disorder 
- Antisocial Personality Disorder 
- Pyromania 
- Kleptomania

## Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD)
- Theoretical Perspectives:
	- Ineffective parenting: Inadvertent reinforcement of difficult, demanding behaviour
		- **Coercive exchange**
			- "Clean up your room"
			- "No! I hate you" Repeatedly
			- *Parent eventually gives up*, Jonny has learned that freaking out and being a jerk gets mom to do something, mom has learned to just not try
	- Used to be on the same spectrum as ADHD
	- In at least one setting, but not all are required
- Treatment
	- Ecological theory
		- "You need to perform treatment in the sphere that the environment that they normally are in"
		- Must practice skills in the situation they are most realistically gonna be used in
	- Multisystemic Therapy (MST)
		- Quantum jump above PMT
		- Talks about all of a kid's social spheres
		- Can often control over one domain (eg. home) but not all
		- Therapist is available 24/7 to teach person social skills and is on call for behavioural intervention
		- periodic planned and unplanned check ins to see behaviour
	- PMT (Russel Barkley, Alan Kazdin)
		- Parent Management Training
			- Teaching learning and behaviour modification concepts to parents
			- Used to shape kids behaviour
			- EXTREMELY effective when parents are in control over a contingency
### ODD DSM-5
A pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness lasting at least 6 months as evidenced by at least four symptoms from any of the following categories, and exhibited during interaction with at least one individual who is not a sibling.

- Angry/Irritable Mood 
	- Often loses temper. 
	- Is often touchy or easily annoyed. 
	- Is often angry and resentful.
- Argumentative/Defiant Behavior 
	- Often argues with authority figures or, for children and adolescents, with adults. 
	- Often actively defies or refuses to comply with requests from authority figures or with rules. 
	- Often deliberately annoys others. 
	- Often blames others for his or her mistakes or misbehavior.
- Vindictiveness
	- Has been spiteful or vindictive at least twice within the past 6 months
## Intermittent Explosive Disorder
- Impulsive or anger-based aggressive outbursts that begin rapidly and have very little build-up. 
- Outbursts often last fewer than 30 minutes and are provoked by minor actions of someone close, often a family member or friend. 
- Aggressive episodes are generally impulsive and/or based in anger rather than premeditated. 
- They typically occur with significant distress or psychosocial functional impairment. 
- The person is at least 6 years of age (or developmentally similar).
- Verbal aggression like temper tantrums, tirades, arguments or fights; or physical aggression toward people, animals, or property. 
- This aggression must occur, on average, twice per week for three months. 
- The physical aggression does not damage or destroy property, nor does it physically injure people or animals. 
**or** 
- Within 12 months, three behavioral outbursts resulting in: 
- Damage or destruction of property, and/or 
- Physical assault that physically injures people or animal
## Conduct Disorder
### DSM-5 
- A repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated, as manifested by the presence of three (or more) of the following criteria in the past 12 months, with at least one criterion present in the past 6 months:
	- **Aggression to people and animals**
		- often bullies, threatens, or intimidates others 
		- often initiates physical fights 
		- has used a weapon that can cause serious physical harm to others (e.g., a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) 
		- has been physically cruel to people 
		- has been physically cruel to animals 
		- has stolen while confronting a victim (e.g., mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery) 
		- has forced someone into sexual activity
	- **Destruction of property**
		- as deliberately engaged in fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage
		- has deliberately destroyed others' property (other than by fire setting)
	- **Deceitfulness or theft**
		- has broken into someone else's house, building, or car 
		- often lies to obtain goods or favors or to avoid obligations (i.e., "cons" others) 
		- has stolen items of nontrivial value without confronting a victim (e.g., shoplifting, but without breaking and entering; forgery)
	- **Serious violations of rules**
		- often stays out at night despite parental prohibitions, beginning before age 13 years 
		- has run away from home overnight at least twice while living in parental or parental surrogate home (or once without returning for a lengthy period) 
		- is often truant from school, beginning before age 13
- ==Differentials include ODD and Antisocial Personality Disorder (APD cannot be diagnosed before 18)==
### Treatment
- Most effective treatments are delivered in a structured setting and include:
	- Continued education 
	- Anger management 
	- Victim empathy training 
	- Relapse prevention 
		- Identify triggers and learn to resist relapse due to them
	- Substance abuse desistence 
	- Family therapy
	- **All of this is VERY CBT**
- *Individual psychotherapy of little use*.
- Meds of limited value but some possible success with mood stabilizers & neuleptics, but not for frankly antisocial kids.
# NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDERS
- Delirium 
- Dementia 
- Traumatic Brain Injury
![[Pasted image 20240521171245.png|500]]
- Adults tend to be more mentally healthy over time
- Need to differentiate on the basis of severity:
	- **Major**
		- Significant cognitive decline
		- Interference with independence in daily activities
	- **Mild**
		- Moderate cognitive decline
		- Still capable of functioning with independence

- Several type specifiers
	- Alzheimer's disease
		- Most common
	- Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (eg., Pick's)
	- Lewy body disease
	- Vascular disease
	- TBI
	- Substance/medication use
	- Prion disease (PRoteinacious INfectious particle) (Jacob-Creutzfeldt)
		- Contagious
## Prion Diseased Brain vs Control
![[Pasted image 20240521171550.png]]
- AAAAAH I hate this
## Age-related cognitive decline
![[Pasted image 20240521171631.png]]
## Vascular dementias (ON EXAM)
- Stepwise decline (due to strokes)
	- Full stroke or mini stroke is cause
	- Declining step function in ability over time
## Delirium
- May produce *dementia-like impairment*
	- Disturbances in orientation, memory, concentration, perception. Reduced/clouded consciousness.
- Often attributable to medical illness (eg., bladder infections)
	- Will generally clear within a few days of underlying physical illness resolving
	- Therefore always check white cell count and assess for other symptoms & signs of infection
	- Anywhere from *10 to 50% of seniors admitted to hospital for surgery* will have, or develop, delirium
- Onset tends to be rapid (i.e., hours to days)
- AD and vascular dementias much more gradual (see next slide).
## Dementia
- A form of cognitive impairment involving generalized progressive deficits in a person’*s memory and learning of new information, ability to communicate, judgment, and motor coordination*.
- **Alzheimer’s disease (AD):** Fatal neurodegenerative disorder that accounts for the majority of dementia cases.
	- Beta 
	- Frustrating for the patient, can often cause paranoia
	- Family often fails to notice it as a condition, not recognizing that changes are caused by a disease
	- First line of Tx: Cholinesterase inhibitors
		- Helps to slow down progress, not a "fix"
	- Conclusively diagnosed posthumously
		- Plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cell death, substantial cortical atrophy (see next slide)
		- Definitive diagnosis of Alzheimer's can only be given after death, can diagnose dementia while alive.
	- Neuropsych testing very sensitive and specific
		- Shows damage once the disease is far along
		- Sensitive  = detect early, specific = know it's dementia
- **Vascular Dementias:** Best addressed by controlling cardiovascular risk factors (BP, Diabetes, Smoking, Cholesterol) 
	- Step-wise decrement in functioning 
	- Tends to show up with diagnostic imaging (structure, not function) 
- **Mixed:** Co-occurrence of both forms
