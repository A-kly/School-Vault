# Objectives
- 3 sections stuck together
- Provide understanding of relationship between developmental expectations and psychopathy
- Discuss some disorders normally diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and also in the senior years
- discuss theoretical and treatment issues and how they may change as a function of age
- provide a brief overview of treatment oralities for various disorders in this section
# 3 distinct sections
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders
	- Usually evident in childhood often before grade school
- Disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders
	- Problems with behaviour and emotional regulation
- Neurocognitive Disorders
	- Disruptions in previously normal cognitive ability
# Abnormal Behaviour Across Lifespan
- Historically, children were considered mini adults with the same level of brain function
- The psychological problems experienced by children and young people are often *especially poignant in that they affect children at a time in their lives when they have relatively little ability to cope*. 
- Some problems of childhood *prevent children from reaching their potential*; others mirror the problems faced by adults.
- Finally, there are some problems unique to childhood or disorders that manifest themselves differently in children compared to adults.
- Normal vs abnormal behaviour must be considered along with developmental issues as well as ethnicity and gender and age.
- Need to consider
	- Neurodevelopmental differences
	- Learning history
	- Emotional Resilience
	- Solidification of personality
		- Personality very similar to early life personality
# Neurodevelopmental Disorders
- Intellectual Disability
- Autism Spectrum Disorders
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) – Specific Learning Disorder
- Motor Disorders
- Communication Disorder
## Historically
- Caring for ill children is a recently adopted value
	- Ancient Greece: Left to die, thrown off cliff
- Do we think this is universally awful?
	- Terminating pregnancies where fetal cells show signs of Down's Syndrome?
	- Lower surgical and medical priority for severely disabled individuals
		- Organ transplants for example
## Intellectual Disability Disorder
- Based on level of adaptive functioning, not IQ alone
	- Mild
	- Moderate
	- Severe
	- Profound
- Social adjustment can have a significant bearing on life success
	- Agreeable, kind, non aggressive = easy to find caregivers
### Causes
- Prenatal Factors 
	- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
		- Human herpes type 5
		- 90% of adults have it at age 60, neurodevelopment is done by then
	- Inadequate diet during pregnancy 
	- Maternal (while pregnant) 
		- Drinking (FASD)
			- Look at:
				- Growth impairment (below 3rd percentile in height and weight at birth)
				- look at prenatal exposure to alcohol
				- Probability of CNS damage
		- Valproate 
			- medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches
		- Smoking 
		- Antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs 
		- Heavy metals (lead, mercury)
- Cultural-Familial causes
	- Cultural-familial intellectual impairment
		- Childhood punishment practices
		- Home environment
- Intervention
	- Mainstreaming vs specialization
		- specialization: target very specific issues and work on them (special ed)
		- Mainstreaming: put them in a normal social environment and they can work on building these skills on their own (normal class)
	- Diagnostic overshadowing
		- One condition covering up other conditions
		- Hidden comorbidities can lead to other issues and make helping the person harder
#### Medical conditions
- Down Syndrome
- Fragile X Syndrome
- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
- Smith-Lemil-Opitz Syndrome
- Tay-Sachs disease
## Savant syndrome
- Condition where a person with a neurodevelopmental disorder can perform exceptionally in a specific domain such as mathematics.
- Savant Syndrome occurs in *0.06% of those with intellectual disability* and is **closely linked to autism** spectrum disorder. It occurs about six times more often in males than females.
## Autism Spectrum Disorder
- Involves markedly impaired behaviour or functioning in multiple areas of development.
- ASD often becomes apparent in first few years of life and is often associated with intellectual disability when it is diagnosed early.
- Larger group of ASD individuals are not considered high needs and do not have a marked intellectual disability. Would have been considered Asperger's.
- Before spectrum definition
	- L. Kanner
		- Kanner Syndrome
		- Unaffectionate children
		- More of a learned behaviour theory
	- B. Bettelheim
		- Refrigerator mothers
		- More to do with mother's behaviour
		- WRONG
### DSM-5 Criteria
- A. **Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts**, as manifested by the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive, see text): 
	1. *Deficits in social-emotional reciprocity*, ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure of normal back-and-forth conversation; to reduced sharing of interests, emotions, or affect; to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. 
	2. *Deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction*, ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and nonverbal communication; to abnormalities in eye contact and body language or deficits in understanding and use of gestures; to a total lack of facial expressions and nonverbal communication. 
	3. *Deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships*, ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behavior to suit various social contexts; to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends; to absence of interest in peers.
- B. **Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities**, as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive; see text): 
	1. *Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements*, use of objects, or speech (e.g., simple motor stereotypies, lining up toys or flipping objects, echolalia, idiosyncratic phrases).
	2. *Insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines, or ritualized patterns or verbal nonverbal behavior* (e.g., extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day). 
	3. *Highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus* (e.g, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interest). 
	4. *Hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment* (e.g., apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse response to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement).
- C. Symptoms must be present in the **early developmental period** (but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life).
- D. **Symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of current functioning**.
- E. These disturbances are **not better explained by intellectual disability** (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. Intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur; to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level.
### Theoretical Perspectives
- O. Ivar Løvaas
	- Hypothesized *inability to process more than one sensory datum at a time*.
		- Not actually inability, just difficult
	- Leads to conditioning deficits 
		- Association is difficult establish
- Simon Baron-Cohen (paternal cousin of Sasha Baron-Cohen (borat))
	- Theory of Mind
		- Autistic person does not have the ability to put themselves in the shoes of another person
		- Reduced empathy
- Neurodevelopmental Deficits
	- Evidence of structural abnormalities is inconsistent
		- Area around *Nucellus Acumens* has an early burst of growth in terms of neurological development 
### Treatment
- Intensive behavioural intervention
	- Lovass (1987) 40 hours/wk x 2 years = normal IQ scores for just under half of 19 subjects.
		- Not actually inability, just difficult to compensate
		- Practice helps a lot, intensive practice to overcome intellectual deficits
- Social simulation (eg., FaceSay)
	- Social practice for autistic people
## ADHD in the DSM-5
- A. Six or more of the following symptoms of *inattention* have been present for at least 6 months to a point that is inappropriate for developmental level: 
	- Often does not give close attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork, work, or other activities. 
	- Often has trouble keeping attention on tasks or play activities. 
	- Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly. 
	- Often does not follow through on instructions and fails to finish schoolwork, chores, or duties in the workplace (not due to oppositional behavior or failure to understand instructions). 
	- Often has trouble organizing activities. 
	- Often avoids, dislikes, or doesn't want to do things that take a lot of mental effort for a long period of time (such as schoolwork or homework). 
	- Often loses things needed for tasks and activities (e.g. toys, school assignments, pencils, books, or tools). 
	- Is often easily distracted. 
	- Is often forgetful in daily activities.
- B. Six or more of the following symptoms of *hyperactivity- impulsivity* have been present for at least 6 months to an extent that is disruptive and inappropriate for developmental level:
	- Often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat when sitting still is expected.
	- Often gets up from seat when remaining in seat is expected. 
	- Often excessively runs about or climbs when and where it is not appropriate (adolescents or adults may feel very restless). 
	- Often has trouble playing or doing leisure activities quietly. 
	- Is often "on the go" or often acts as if "driven by a motor". 
	- Often talks excessively. 
	- Impulsivity 
	- Often blurts out answers before questions have been finished. – Often has trouble waiting one's turn. 
	- Often interrupts or intrudes on others (e.g., butts into conversations or games).
