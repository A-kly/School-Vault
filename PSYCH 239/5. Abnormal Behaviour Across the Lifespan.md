# Objectives
- 3 sections stuck together
- Provide understanding of relationship between developmental expectations and psychopathy
- Discuss some disorders normally diagnosed in childhood or adolescence and also in the senior years
- discuss theoretical and treatment issues and how they may change as a function of age
- provide a brief overview of treatment oralities for various disorders in this section
# 3 distinct sections
- Neurodevelopmental Disorders
	- Usually evident in childhood often before grade school
- Disruptive, impulse control and conduct disorders
	- Problems with behaviour and emotional regulation
- Neurocognitive Disorders
	- Disruptions in previously normal cognitive ability
# Abnormal Behaviour Across Lifespan
- Historically, children were considered mini adults with the same level of brain function
- The psychological problems experienced by children and young people are often *especially poignant in that they affect children at a time in their lives when they have relatively little ability to cope*. 
- Some problems of childhood *prevent children from reaching their potential*; others mirror the problems faced by adults.
- Finally, there are some problems unique to childhood or disorders that manifest themselves differently in children compared to adults.
- Normal vs abnormal behaviour must be considered along with developmental issues as well as ethnicity and gender and age.
- Need to consider
	- Neurodevelopmental differences
	- Learning history
	- Emotional Resilience
	- Solidification of personality
		- Personality very similar to early life personality
# Neurodevelopmental Disorders
- Intellectual Disability
- Autism Spectrum Disorders
- Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) â€“ Specific Learning Disorder
- Motor Disorders
- Communication Disorder
## Historically
- Caring for ill children is a recently adopted value
	- Ancient Greece: Left to die, thrown off cliff
- Do we think this is universally awful?
	- Terminating pregnancies where fetal cells show signs of Down's Syndrome?
	- Lower surgical and medical priority for severely disabled individuals
		- Organ transplants for example
## Intellectual Disability Disorder
- Based on level of adaptive functioning, not IQ alone
	- Mild
	- Moderate
	- Severe
	- Profound
- Social adjustment can have a significant bearing on life success
	- Agreeable, kind, non aggressive = easy to find caregivers
### Causes
- Prenatal Factors 
	- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
		- Human herpes type 5
		- 90% of adults have it at age 60, neurodevelopment is done by then
	- Inadequate diet during pregnancy 
	- Maternal (while pregnant) 
		- Drinking (FASD)
			- Look at:
				- Growth impairment (below 3rd percentile in height and weight at birth)
				- look at prenatal exposure to alcohol
				- Probability of CNS damage
		- Valproate 
			- medications primarily used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder and prevent migraine headaches
		- Smoking 
		- Antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs 
		- Heavy metals (lead, mercury)
- Cultural-Familial causes
	- Cultural-familial intellectual impairment
		- Childhood punishment practices
		- Home environment
- Intervention
	- Mainstreaming vs specialization
		- 
	- Diagnostic overshadowing
