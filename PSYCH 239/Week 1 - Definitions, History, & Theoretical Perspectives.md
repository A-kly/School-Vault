# What is abnormal psychology?
"Abnormal psychology is the branch of the science of psychology that addresses the description, causes, and treatment of abnormal behaviour patterns." (Nevid et al., 2019, pg. 2)

# How do we define abnormal?
(First 3 are relative to culture)
1. is it unusual?
2. does the behavior violate social norms?
3. does it involve a faulty interpretation of reality?
4. does it cause personal distress?
5. is it maladaptive?
6. is it dangerous to the person or others?
- **This is all important in order for us to quantify "exactly" what abnormal behaviour is** 

# Factors affecting our label of abnormal
## Culture
- Normal in one culture may be abnormal in another culture
- Need to understand how different cultures experience different states of emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, rather than imposing out perspectives on them.
- Failure to recognize cultureal differences can lead to inadequate and inaoorioruate treatment.
## Context
- Definition of abnormal behaviour depends a lot on context.
