Notes: [[Intro and Theoretical Perspectives (2024).pdf]]


# Objectives
1. get familiar with the challenges of defining abnormal psychology
2. appreciate widespread nature if mental illness and risk factors
3. trace historical theoretical and scientific roots of abnormal psychology.
4. Review supernatural, biological, medical, psychological, sociological, and interactionist approaches to the understanding of abnormal behaviour.
# What is abnormal psychology?
"Abnormal psychology is the branch of the science of psychology that addresses the description, causes, and treatment of abnormal behaviour patterns." (Nevid et al., 2019, pg. 2)

# How do we define abnormal?
(First 3 are relative to culture)
1. is it unusual?
2. does the behavior violate social norms?
3. does it involve a faulty interpretation of reality?
4. does it cause personal distress?
5. is it maladaptive?
6. is it dangerous to the person or others?
- **This is all important in order for us to quantify "exactly" what abnormal behaviour is** 

# Factors affecting our label of abnormal
## Culture
- Normal in one culture may be abnormal in another culture
- Need to understand how different cultures experience different states of emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, rather than imposing out perspectives on them.
- Failure to recognize cultural differences can lead to inadequate and inappropriate treatment.
## Context
- Definition of abnormal behaviour depends a lot on context.

# Why study it?
- Affects everyone in one way or another
- When abnormal behaviour involves a disturbance in functioning and behaviour, they are classified as **psychological disorders**
- 20% of Canadians will suffer from a psychological disorder in their lifetime
# How common?
- Anxiety: 30%
- Mood: 20%
- Substance Abuse: 15%
- *Any disorder: 46%*
# Risk Factors
- Age
- Education
- Childhood Trauma
- Current stress
- Life events
- Lack of social supports
- Gender
- Physical health
- Genetic Predisposition
## Details
- Exponentially increased effect when we have multiple risk factors
- Two risk factors can induce an 4x increase in adverse outcomes
- 4+ factors can induce 10x chance of mental disorder
# Historical views
- **Demonological model:** *Not the person's fault, they are being inhabited/ controlled and they must be freed or remove the bad spiritual thing that is ailing them*
	- Not originating in Medeval times
	- Trephining: *Holes cut in the head in order to vent something out of the person, demon, spirit or something else.*

- Medeval Times
	- Demonological model
	- Exorcism
- Witchcraft
	- Malleus Maleficarum
		- *Maleficarum = gender neutral witch*
		- *Malleus = hammer*
		- This is a manual for "diagnosing" someone as a Maleficarum
		- people were often tortured when they were "found out"
		- Demonological model + control over those demons by the Maleficarum
		- Based a lot on finding a cause

- Medical Model: *A normally functioning individual is not broken, an abnormally behaving individual has something broken in them and in order to treat we can fix that thing*
