# FEEDING & EATING DISORDERS
- Eating disorders like bulimia nervosa & anorexia nervosa often affect people of high school or college age, especially young women.
	- Incidence tends to be significantly higher in females than males.
- More common in Transgender people
- **Two main types: Anorexia Nervosa & Bulimia Nervosa**
## Anorexia Nervosa
- Anorexia Nervosa: An eating disorder primarily affecting young women, characterized by maintenance of an abnormally low body weight, distortions of body image, intense fear of gaining weight, and, in females, amenorrhea.
### DSM-5: Anorexia Nervosa
- A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
- B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
- C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
- Type: **Restricting Type vs. Binge-Eating/Purging Type**.
### Tools for gauging body image distortion
![[Pasted image 20240604160743.png]]
- Severity is based largely on Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated from weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Problem: (fails to take body composition into account)
- BMI = kg / m2 Low end of normal range is considered to be 18.5 by WHO and CDC, with 17.0 considered "moderate to severe "thinness"
- Mild              >= 17
- Moderate    16 - 16.99
- Severe         15 - 15.99
- Extreme       < 15
- In partial remission (some but not all criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
- In full remission (no criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
	- **Note: A particular clinical challenge is caring for transgender youth with eating disorders is the use of standard growth charts based on sex**
### Medical complications of Anorexia
- Amenorrhea
	- Low estrogen
- Osteoporosis
	- Fractures
	- Inadequate dietary calcium
- Kidney damage
	- Dehydration
	- Laxative abuse
- Heart arrhythmias
- Hypotension
- Anemia
- Death (about 15% of patients)
	- Malnutrition
	- Suicide
## Bulimia Nervosa
- An eating disorder characterized by a recurrent pattern of binge eating followed by self-induced purging and accompanied by persistent overconcern with body weight & image.
### DSM-5: Bulimia Nervosa
- A. Recurrent episodes of *binge eating*. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
	1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), *an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances*.
	2. A sense of *lack of control* over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).
- B. Recurrent inappropriate *compensatory behaviors* in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.
- C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
- D. *Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight*.
- E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.
- Specifiers: 
	- Mild (1-3/wk) 
	- Moderate (4-7) 
	- Severe (8-13) 
	- Extreme (14 or more)
	- In partial remission (some but not all criteria met for a “sustained period of time”)
	- In full remission (no criteria met for a “sustained period of time”)
### Medical complications of Bulimia
- Tooth erosion, cavities, and gum problems
- Blockage of salivary ducts
- Pancreatitis
- Water retention, swelling, and abdominal bloating
- Acute stomach distress
- Fluid loss with low potassium levels
	- extreme weakness (near paralysis)
	- Heart arrhythmias
- Irregular periods
- esophagus damage (including rupture)
	- Mallory Weis tear
- Weakening of the rectal walls
- **Behavioral complications**
	- Substance abuse (30 to 70%)
	- Impulsive behaviors (up to 50%)
		- Promiscuity
		- Cutting
		- Theft
## Binge-Eating Disorder
- A New DSM-5 diagnostic category that involves the same binge-eating features found in Bulimia Nervosa but without the behaviour aiming to compensate for the bingeing (eg. purging).
## Differences / overlap
![[Pasted image 20240604161853.png]]
## Risk Factors (both Anorexia and Bulimia)
- Participation in competitive activities that emphasize endurance, aesthetics, and weight levels put athletes at risk for developing an eating disorder.
- Female gender
- Age in late teens to early 20s
- Having a first degree relative with an eating disorder
- Social pressures including distorted media portrayals
- Emotional issues such as: Low self-esteem, perfectionism, anger issues, depression, anxiety, OCD, impulsivity, need for control.
## Causes of Anorexia & Bulimia
- Sociocultural Factors 
- Psychosocial Factors 
- Family Factors & Eating Disorders 
	- Systems perspective 
- Biological Factors
## Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa & Bulimia Nervosa
- Hospitalization
- Cognitive analytic therapy
- Family therapy
- CBT
- interpersonal psychotherapy
	- *ON EXAM, ALWAYS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS that are malfunctioning or lost*
	- *psychodynamic*

# SLEEP – WAKE DISORDERS
- Diagnostic category representing persistent or recurrent sleep- related problems that cause significant personal distress or impaired functioning.
- DYSSOMNIAS
	- Insomnia Disorder
	- Hypersomnolence Disorder
	- Narcolepsy
- Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders
	- Central Sleep Apnea
	- Sleep-Related Hypoventilation
	- Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders
- Parasomnias
	- Nightmare Disorder (during REM stage)
	- Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders
	- REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder
	- Restless Leg Syndrome
	- Substance/Medication Induced
## NORMAL SLEEP STAGES
- Stage 1 (Nl):
	- light, transitional from wakefulness
	- high amplitude theta (slow) waves on EEG
	- Lasts about 5 - 10 minutes
- Stage 2 (N2):
	- EEG shows bursts of fast activity (sleep spindles)
	- HR & temperature drops
- Stage 3 (N3):
	- Moving from transitional to deeper stages
	- **Deep**, increasing slow wave EEG activity (delta band)
- Stage 4 (N4):
	- 'Delta sleep' predominance of delta band EEG activity
	- Lasts about 30 minutes
	- If sleeper is prone to enuresis or sleepwalking, it will most likely start here.
- Stage 5 (REM):
	- REM sleep or "paradoxical sleep", **dreaming occurs**
	- **Voluntary muscles are paralyzed**, brain active, respiration increases
![[Pasted image 20240604164955.png]]
## SLEEP ARCHITECTURE
![[Pasted image 20240604165019.png]]
- As we age, slow wave (Stages 3 & 4) sleep decreases and Stage 1 increases which makes us easier to wake.
	- Hence there is a heighten incidence of insomnia.
## TYPES OF SLEEP DISORDERS
### Dyssomnias
- Insomnia Disorder (onset, interrupted, early waking) 
- Hypersomnia (Hypersomnolence Disorder) 
- Narcolepsy (http://youtu.be/l2x14qETS7E) 
	-  Loss of the chemical hypocretin in the hypothalamus 
	- Cataplexy 
	-  Dysregulation of sleep stages
		- Fast movement into deep sleep = muscle paralysis at dangerous times 
- Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder
- Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders 
	- Apnea
	- Snoring 
	- Airway closes partially or completely
	- More likely in obese or sedated individuals (eg., sleeping pills or alcohol) 
	- Airway may remain closed up to 90 seconds!
		- Usually sleeper reflexively sits up 
		- Causes profound interruption in sleep as it occurs many times per night 
		- Poor oxygenation 
		- Highly disruptive to sleeping partner
	- **Treatment** 
		- CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) machine. 
		- Surgery (usually laser) to remove excess tissue enlargements.
		- ![[Pasted image 20240604165403.png|400]]
- Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) “Sleeping Beauty” Syndrome
	- Recurring periods of excessive amounts of sleep, behavior changes, and impaired understanding of the world.
	- Episodes may continue for 10 years or more.
### Parasomnias
- Nightmare Disorder
- During REM
- Wakes up
e Tend to
•Non-REM
•Sleep Terror (Stages 3 and 4)
—Not remembered
—Awaken confused and disoriented
—Don't usually wake up
—Often confused and disoriented if awoken
—Little recollection of dream content
—"Sexsomnia" variant
