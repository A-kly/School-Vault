# FEEDING & EATING DISORDERS
- Eating disorders like bulimia nervosa & anorexia nervosa often affect people of high school or college age, especially young women.
	- Incidence tends to be significantly higher in females than males.
- More common in Transgender people
- **Two main types: Anorexia Nervosa & Bulimia Nervosa**
	- Anorexia Nervosa: An eating disorder primarily affecting young women, characterized by maintenance of an abnormally low body weight, distortions of body image, intense fear of gaining weight, and, in females, amenorrhea.
## DSM-5: Anorexia Nervosa
- A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
- B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
- C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
- Type: **Restricting Type vs. Binge-Eating/Purging Type**.
### Tools for gauging body image distortion

- Severity is based largely on Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated from weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Problem: (fails to take body composition into account)
- BMI = kg / m2 Low end of normal range is considered to be 18.5 by WHO and CDC, with 17.0 considered "moderate to severe "thinness"
- Mild              >= 17
- Moderate    16 - 16.99
- Severe         15 - 15.99
- Extreme       < 15
- In partial remission (some but not all criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
- In full remission (no criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
