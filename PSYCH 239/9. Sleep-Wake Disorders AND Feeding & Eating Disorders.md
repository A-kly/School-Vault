# FEEDING & EATING DISORDERS
- Eating disorders like bulimia nervosa & anorexia nervosa often affect people of high school or college age, especially young women.
	- Incidence tends to be significantly higher in females than males.
- More common in Transgender people
- **Two main types: Anorexia Nervosa & Bulimia Nervosa**
## Anorexia Nervosa
- Anorexia Nervosa: An eating disorder primarily affecting young women, characterized by maintenance of an abnormally low body weight, distortions of body image, intense fear of gaining weight, and, in females, amenorrhea.
### DSM-5: Anorexia Nervosa
- A. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected.
- B. Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight.
- C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self- evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
- Type: **Restricting Type vs. Binge-Eating/Purging Type**.
### Tools for gauging body image distortion
![[Pasted image 20240604160743.png]]
- Severity is based largely on Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated from weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
- Problem: (fails to take body composition into account)
- BMI = kg / m2 Low end of normal range is considered to be 18.5 by WHO and CDC, with 17.0 considered "moderate to severe "thinness"
- Mild              >= 17
- Moderate    16 - 16.99
- Severe         15 - 15.99
- Extreme       < 15
- In partial remission (some but not all criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
- In full remission (no criteria met for a "sustained period of time")
	- **Note: A particular clinical challenge is caring for transgender youth with eating disorders is the use of standard growth charts based on sex**
### Medical complications of Anorexia
- Amenorrhea
	- Low estrogen
- Osteoporosis
	- Fractures
	- Inadequate dietary calcium
- Kidney damage
	- Dehydration
	- Laxative abuse
- Heart arrhythmias
- Hypotension
- Anemia
- Death (about 15% of patients)
	- Malnutrition
	- Suicide
## Bulimia Nervosa
- An eating disorder characterized by a recurrent pattern of binge eating followed by self-induced purging and accompanied by persistent overconcern with body weight & image.
### DSM-5: Bulimia Nervosa
- A. Recurrent episodes of *binge eating*. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
	1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g., within any 2-hour period), *an amount of food that is definitely larger than what most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances*.
	2. A sense of *lack of control* over eating during the episode (e.g., a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).
- B. Recurrent inappropriate *compensatory behaviors* in order to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise.
- C. The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for 3 months.
- D. *Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight*.
- E. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.
- Specifiers: 
	- Mild (1-3/wk) 
	- Moderate (4-7) 
	- Severe (8-13) 
	- Extreme (14 or more)
	- In partial remission (some but not all criteria met for a “sustained period of time”)
	- In full remission (no criteria met for a “sustained period of time”)
### Medical complications of Bulimia
- Tooth erosion, cavities, and gum problems
- Blockage of salivary ducts
- Pancreatitis
- Water retention, swelling, and abdominal bloating
- Acute stomach distress
- Fluid loss with low potassium levels
	- extreme weakness (near paralysis)
	- Heart arrhythmias
- Irregular periods
- esophagus damage (including rupture)
	- Mallory Weis tear
- Weakening of the rectal walls
- **Behavioral complications**
	- Substance abuse (30 to 70%)
	- Impulsive behaviors (up to 50%)
		- Promiscuity
		- Cutting
		- Theft
## Binge-Eating Disorder
- A New DSM-5 diagnostic category that involves the same binge-eating features found in Bulimia Nervosa but without the behaviour aiming to compensate for the bingeing (eg. purging).
## Differences / overlap
![[Pasted image 20240604161853.png]]
## Risk Factors (both Anorexia and Bulimia)
- Participation in competitive activities that emphasize endurance, aesthetics, and weight levels put athletes at risk for developing an eating disorder.
- Female gender
- Age in late teens to early 20s
- Having a first degree relative with an eating disorder
- Social pressures including distorted media portrayals
- Emotional issues such as: Low self-esteem, perfectionism, anger issues, depression, anxiety, OCD, impulsivity, need for control.
## Causes of Anorexia & Bulimia
- Sociocultural Factors 
- Psychosocial Factors 
- Family Factors & Eating Disorders 
	- Systems perspective 
- Biological Factors
## Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa & Bulimia Nervosa
- Hospitalization

# SLEEP – WAKE DISORDERS
- Diagnostic category representing persistent or recurrent sleep- related problems that cause significant personal distress or impaired functioning.
- DYSSOMNIAS
	- Insomnia Disorder
	- Hypersomnolence Disorder
	- Narcolepsy
- Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders
	- Central Sleep Apnea
	- Sleep-Related Hypoventilation
	- Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders
- Parasomnias
	- Nightmare Disorder (during REM stage)
	- Non-REM Sleep Arousal Disorders
	- REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder
	- Restless Leg Syndrome
	- Substance/Medication Induced
## NORMAL SLEEP STAGES
- Stage 1 (Nl):
	- light, transitional from wakefulness
	- high amplitude theta (slow) waves on EEG
	- Lasts about 5 - 10 minutes
- Stage 2 (N2):
	- EEG shows bursts of fast activity (sleep spindles)
	- HR & temperature drops
- Stage 3 (N3):
	- Moving from transitional to deeper stages
	- **Deep**, increasing slow wave EEG activity (delta band)
- Stage 4 (N4):
	- 'Delta sleep' predominance of delta band EEG activity
	- Lasts about 30 minutes
	- If sleeper is prone to enuresis or sleepwalking, it will most likely start here.
- Stage 5 (REM):
	- REM sleep or "paradoxical sleep", **dreaming occurs**
	- **Voluntary muscles are paralyzed**, brain active, respiration increases
![[Pasted image 20240604164955.png]]
## SLEEP ARCHITECTURE
![[Pasted image 20240604165019.png]]
- As we age, slow wave (Stages 3 & 4) sleep decreases and Stage 1 increases which makes us easier to wake.
	- Hence there is a heighten incidence of insomnia.
## TYPES OF SLEEP DISORDERS
### Dyssomnias
- Insomnia Disorder
	- onset
		- Can't fall asleep
	- interrupted
		- Continuously wakes up
	- early waking
		- Wakes up way too early
- Hypersomnia (Hypersomnolence Disorder)
	- Carries risks
	- Makes people wanna sleep more and more
- Narcolepsy
	-  Loss of the chemical hypocretin in the hypothalamus
	- Cataplexy
	-  Dysregulation of sleep stages
		- Fast movement into deep sleep = muscle paralysis at dangerous times
- Circadian Rhythm Sleep Disorder
	- Roughly 24 hour internal cycle
	- Tends to show up when people have lifestyles or job requirements that conflict with each other
	- Unable to sleep after change in routine
- Breathing-Related Sleep Disorders 
	- Apnea
	- Snoring 
	- Airway closes partially or completely
	- More likely in obese or sedated individuals (eg., sleeping pills or alcohol) 
	- Airway may remain closed up to 90 seconds!
		- Usually sleeper reflexively sits up 
		- Causes profound interruption in sleep as it occurs many times per night 
		- Poor oxygenation 
		- Highly disruptive to sleeping partner
	- **Treatment** 
		- Loose weight if obese
		- Stop sedatives if they rely on them
		- CPAP (Continuous Positive Air Pressure) machine.

		- ![[Pasted image 20240604165403.png|400]]
- Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) “Sleeping Beauty” Syndrome
	- Recurring periods of excessive amounts of sleep, behavior changes, and impaired understanding of the world.
	- Episodes may continue for 10 years or more.
### Parasomnias
- Nightmare Disorder
	- Must be During REM
	- Wakes up
	- Tend to remember
	- Must be persistent in order to diagnose nightmare disorder
- Non-REM
	- Sleep Terror (Stages 3 and 4)
		- 1-10 minutes
		- Decrease with age
		- Not remembered
		- Awaken confused and disoriented
	- Sleepwalking

## Treatment of Sleep-Wake Disorders
- Biological Approaches
	- Benzodiazepines (Anxiolytics)
		- Risk of dependence
		- Diminished REM
		- Should only be used short-term
		- Many drugs can suppress REM sleep
- Psychological Approaches
	- Cognitive-behavioural techniques
		- lower physiological arousal and address sleep hygiene & emotional state.
		- People can develop anticipatory anxiety that may respond to identifying rational alternate thoughts.
## Overcoming Insomnia 
1. Retire to bed only when you feel sleepy. 
2. Limit bed activities to sleeping. 
3. If after 20 minutes you are unable to fall asleep, get out of bed & relax. 
4. Establish a regular routine. 
5. Avoid naps during the daytime. 
6. Avoid ruminating in bed. 
7. Relax before sleeping. 
8. Establish a regular daytime exercise schedule. 
9. Avoid caffeinated beverages. 
10. Practice rational restructuring for self-defeating thoughts.
