# Types
- DSM uses two major categories of substance-related disorders:
	- **Substance use disorders:** Patterns of *maladaptive behaviour involving the use of a psychoactive substance*. Substance-use disorders include *substance-abuse* disorders and *substance dependence* disorders. 
	- **Substance-induced disorders:** Disorders *induced by the use of psychoactive substances*, including intoxication, withdrawal syndromes, mood disorders, delirium, and amnesia.
	- Withdrawal symptoms are **OPOSITE** of the drug effect
- Other addictive disorders
	- Problem gambling behaviour was considered an *impulse control disorder* in former editions of the DSM. In DSM-5, *gambling disorder* is classified with other substance use disorders. Gambling disorder has commonalities in expression, causes, comorbidity, and treatment with substance use disorders. 
	- The broader category, though not formally mentioned in DSM is process addictions. â€“ Partial exception is *Internet Gaming Disorder* (Conditions for further study: in Appendix 3)
