# Types
- DSM uses two major categories of substance-related disorders:
	- **Substance use disorders:** Patterns of *maladaptive behaviour involving the use of a psychoactive substance*. Substance-use disorders include *substance-abuse* disorders and *substance dependence* disorders. 
	- **Substance-induced disorders:** Disorders *induced by the use of psychoactive substances*, including intoxication, withdrawal syndromes, mood disorders, delirium, and amnesia.
	- Withdrawal symptoms are **OPOSITE** of the drug effect
- Other addictive disorders
	- Problem gambling behaviour was considered an *impulse control disorder* in former editions of the DSM. In DSM-5, *gambling disorder* is classified with other substance use disorders. Gambling disorder has commonalities in expression, causes, comorbidity, and treatment with substance use disorders. 
	- The broader category, though not formally mentioned in DSM is process addictions. – Partial exception is *Internet Gaming Disorder* (Conditions for further study: in Appendix 3)

# Hallmarks of Disordered Substance Use
- Tachycardia
- Delirium tremens
	- Alcohol causes disruption of *thymine* (vitamin B1)
	- tremens = shaky
	- delirium = symptoms of delirium
	- Very high quantities of alcohol over at least a month, and then stopping
	- treatment:
		- thymine (vitamin B1) supplements
		- other, non alcohol, CNS depressant
- Delirium
- Disorientation
- Physiological dependence (Addiction)
	- Tolerance
		- Consume more and more without getting the effect
	- Withdrawal
		- Body compensating causes opposite, unpleasant effects
- Psychological Dependence
	- Happens without actual Physiological dependence
# DSM-5: Substance Use Disorder (eg., Alcohol)
- A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 
	1. Alcohol is often taken in *larger amounts* or over a *longer period than was intended*. 
	2. There is a *persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use*. 
	3. A great deal of *time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol*, use alcohol, or recover from its effects. 
	4. *Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol*. 
	5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a *failure to fulfill major role obligations* at work, school, or home. 
	6. Continued alcohol *use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems* caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. 
	7. *Important* social, occupational, or recreational *activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use*. 
	8. *Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous*.
	9. Alcohol use is continued despite *knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem* that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol. 
	10. *Tolerance*, as defined by either of the following: 
		- a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect. 
		- b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol. 
	11. *Withdrawal*, as manifested by either of the following: 
		- The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol 
		- Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms
## Specifiers: 

- Mild: Presence of 2-3 symptoms. 
- Moderate: Presence of 4-5 symptoms. 
- Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. 
***
- In early remission (3 to 12 months) 
- In sustained remission (12 months or longer) 
- In a controlled environment
# Top 3 commonly used drugs in North America:
- Tobacco (about 25% of population) 
- Alcohol (about 15% of population) 
- Marijuana (about 5% of population)
# Pathways to Drug Dependence
- Experimentation
	- Most often in a social context
	- *No loss of control*
		- eg. Finite amount, only in certain situations, etc.
- Routine Use
	- Alterations to lifestyle and personal values
	- Borrowing, pawning, theft, lying, manipulation
	- *May still believe they have control*
- Addiction or Dependence
	- Efforts center on avoiding withdrawal symptoms
	- *Life is centered on getting the drug*
# DRUGS OF ABUSE
- **Depressants** : "Depress" CNS activity
	- Alcohol
		- Alcohol dehydrogenase is the enzyme to get rid of it
			- Low levels cause flushed face, high heart rate, increased effect
	- Barbituates
	- Opiates
-  **Stimulants** : Heighten CNS activity
	- Amphetamines
	- Cocaine
	- Nicotine
- **Hallucinogens** : distort sensory perceptions (e.g., *synesthesia*, colors, sounds, textures)
	- LSD
	- Phencyclidine (PCP)
	- Marijuana
- **Inhalants** : GABA effects
	- (GABA involved a lot in anxiety)
## Alcohol
### Risk factors for alcohol
- Risk factors for alcoholism
	- Gender
		- Rates about equal, but women start later and progress faster.
	- Age (starting before 40)
	- Antisocial Personality Disorder
	- Family history
		- Both heritable and modeling effects
	- Sociodemographic factors
		- Lower SES (socioeconomic status) and education, Indigenous > non-Indigenous
		- The damaging effects of alcohol abuse vary across ethnic groups in Canada, likely because of different cultural constraints and biological tolerance of alcohol.
### Alcohol details
- Conceptions of Alcoholism: Disease, Moral Defect, or Behaviour Pattern?
- Psychological Effects of Alcohol
	- Denial
	- Wet brain, Korsakoff's syndrome
		- Long term damage to brain and memory
	- delirium tremmens
		- 2-4 days after stopping heavy drinking
- Physical Health & Alcohol
	- Alcohol-induced Persisting Amnestic Disorder (aka Korsakoff's Syndrome)
		- Confusion, disorientation, recent memory loss
	- Malnutrition
	- FASD
- Moderate Drinking: Is There a Health Benefit?
	- (+) HDL
	- (-) Clotting Risk
	- 14/wk Men
	- 9/wk Women no more than 2 / day for either.
### Accidents
- Alcohol plays a role in deaths due to:
	- Snowmobile accidents: about 77% of cases
	- Homicides: over 50% of cases
	- Traffic Accidents: over 40% of cases
	- Boating accidents: about 40% of cases
	- Suicides: over 20% of cases
## Barbiturates
- Sedatives 
	- Mostly among middle aged adults 
	- Synergistic effect with alcohol (≈ 4x) 
	- Requires medically supervised withdrawal
## Opiates
- Intense rush
	- Narcotics
	- Analgesics
	- Endorphins
## Stimulants
- Cocaine
	- Snorted or injected
	- Often consumed in binges
	- Crack --> for smoking, fast, concentrated rush
	- Freebasing (heating with ether)
	- Effects of Cocaine
		- Birth defects
			- Auditory information processing
	- Sexual dysfunction 
	- (+) body temp, respiratory distress, appetite suppression
- Amphetamines
	- Amphetamine Psychosis
## Nicotine
- Nicotine Dependence
- Factors that play a role in cigarette smoking in Canada:
	- The prevalence of smoking among adults is higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal people, regardless of whether they live rural or urban environments. 
	- Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among the poorer and less well-educated segments of the population.
## HALLUCINOGENS
- Named because of perceptual effects. 
- **Phencyclidine** (PCP)
	- Angel Dust 
		- Snorted
		- Reduce/Remove person's ability to experience pain
		- Creates beliefs of being invulnerable sometimes
- **Marijuana** 
	- Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
		- Diathesis for psychosis can dramatically increase likelihood of drug induced psychosis
		- Like symptoms of schizophrenia
	- Hashish 
	- Higher level of **THC** leads to lower level of **CBD**
		- increased CBD *MAY* have a protective effect against TCH induced psychosis
- **Inhalants** 
	- DA and GABA effects
		- Solvents
		- Gasoline
		- Glue
# Mechanisms of Overdose
## 1) Effective vs Toxic Doses (Primarily Physiological)
- Tolerance to intoxicating effects to a drug and the lethal dose both increase over time. 
- Tolerance builds more quickly. 
	- Over time, the amount of drug necessary to produce the high gets closer and closer to the lethal dose level. 
	- **Neuroadaption:** Brain changes that take place over time to compensate for presence of foreign chemicals.
![[Pasted image 20240523154139.png]]
- Therapeutic (amount necessary to get high) curve moves to the right over time with drug use, toxic curve increases at a much slower rate
## 2) Compensatory Conditioning (Primarily Psychological)
- Over the course of conditioning, a CS may elicit physiological CRs that *oppose* the US (compensatory CRs). These CSs may include *contextual cues present during conditioning*. 
	- Eg., Cytochrome P450
		- Substance the body produces when exposed to toxin
		- Release can be conditioned using compensatory conditioning
- ==This contributes to withdrawal symptoms as well as tolerance.== 
- Siegel et al. (1982) suggested that a **failure** *to elicit such responses might play a part in drug overdose.*
	- **Phase 1:** *(Conditioning Trials)*
		- Two groups of rats were heroin addicted over 30 days. Three conditions: Same Room, Different Room.
		- Same and Different Room groups got heroin every second day, and a saline infusion on odd days. Saline and heroin were given in different rooms. 
	- **Phase 2:** *(Test day)*.
		- Same Room group: Got a double dose of heroin in the room where heroin was usually delivered.
		- Different Room group: Got double dose of heroin where they usually got saline. 
		- Control group: Never had heroin before but got a double dose.
	- **Results:** 
		- Same Room: 32% mortality 
		- Different Room: 64% mortality 
		- Controls : 100% mortality

	- **Note:** CS’s (cues) for drug use will also frequently trigger cravings and withdrawal symptoms.
# THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES 
## Biological Perspectives
- Neurotransmitters 
	- Dopamine 
		- Drugs + schizophrenia = worse symptoms
			- Makes antipsychotic medication is way less effective until drugs go away
	- Brain’s Reward Centres
		- Mesolimbic pathway
		- nucleus acumbens
			- Entry point to prefrontal cortex
			- positive reinforcement when dopamine hits this area
			- prime area stimulated with drugs
- Genetic Factors 
	- Addictions tend to run in families 
- Alcohol dehydrogenase 
	- Enzyme
	- Ability to metabolize alcohol 
	- Genetic component
	- Flushing, nausea, intoxication at lower doses
## Learning Perspective
- Operant Conditioning
	- Alcohol & Tension Reduction
		- Alcohol = relaxing and good atmosphere
	- Negative Reinforcement & Withdrawal
		- delirium tremmens
		- cure negative reinforcement of withdrawal with alcohol
- The Conditioning Model of Cravings
	- Cues for substance use
- Observational Learning
	- equate alcohol consumption with maturity
## Cognitive Perspective
- Outcome Expectancies, Decision Making, & Substance
- Self-Efficacy Expectancies
- Does One Slip Cause People with Substance Abuse or Dependence to Go on Binges?
	- Abstinence violation effect (attribution to stable internal factors)
		- Slip up from a person causes 2 things
			- "I can't beat this alcoholism"
			- "This treatment is pointless"
- What You Believe is What You Get
	- Amount consumed is influenced by expectation of alcohol
	- Actual alcohol content didn't matter.
