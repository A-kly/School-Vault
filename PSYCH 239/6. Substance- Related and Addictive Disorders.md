# Types
- DSM uses two major categories of substance-related disorders:
	- **Substance use disorders:** Patterns of *maladaptive behaviour involving the use of a psychoactive substance*. Substance-use disorders include *substance-abuse* disorders and *substance dependence* disorders. 
	- **Substance-induced disorders:** Disorders *induced by the use of psychoactive substances*, including intoxication, withdrawal syndromes, mood disorders, delirium, and amnesia.
	- Withdrawal symptoms are **OPOSITE** of the drug effect
- Other addictive disorders
	- Problem gambling behaviour was considered an *impulse control disorder* in former editions of the DSM. In DSM-5, *gambling disorder* is classified with other substance use disorders. Gambling disorder has commonalities in expression, causes, comorbidity, and treatment with substance use disorders. 
	- The broader category, though not formally mentioned in DSM is process addictions. – Partial exception is *Internet Gaming Disorder* (Conditions for further study: in Appendix 3)

# Hallmarks of Disordered Substance Use
- Tachycardia
- Delirium tremens
	- Alcohol causes disruption of *thymine* (vitamin B1)
	- tremens = shaky
	- delirium = symptoms of delirium
	- Very high quantities of alcohol over at least a month, and then stopping
	- treatment:
		- thymine (vitamin B1) supplements
		- other, non alcohol, CNS depressant
- Delirium
- Disorientation
- Physiological dependence (Addiction)
	- Tolerance
		- Consume more and more without getting the effect
	- Withdrawal
		- Body compensating causes opposite, unpleasant effects
- Psychological Dependence
	- Happens without actual Physiological dependence
# DSM-5: Substance Use Disorder (eg., Alcohol)
- A. A problematic pattern of alcohol use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by at least two of the following, occurring within a 12-month period: 
	1. Alcohol is often taken in *larger amounts* or over a *longer period than was intended*. 
	2. There is a *persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use*. 
	3. A great deal of *time is spent in activities necessary to obtain alcohol*, use alcohol, or recover from its effects. 
	4. *Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol*. 
	5. Recurrent alcohol use resulting in a *failure to fulfill major role obligations* at work, school, or home. 
	6. Continued alcohol *use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems* caused or exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. 
	7. *Important* social, occupational, or recreational *activities are given up or reduced because of alcohol use*. 
	8. *Recurrent alcohol use in situations in which it is physically hazardous*.
	9. Alcohol use is continued despite *knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem* that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by alcohol. 
	10. *Tolerance*, as defined by either of the following: 
		- a. A need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect. 
		- b. A markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of alcohol. 
	11. *Withdrawal*, as manifested by either of the following: 
		- The characteristic withdrawal syndrome for alcohol 
		- Alcohol (or a closely related substance, such as a benzodiazepine) is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms
## Specifiers: 

- Mild: Presence of 2-3 symptoms. 
- Moderate: Presence of 4-5 symptoms. 
- Severe: Presence of 6 or more symptoms. 
***
- In early remission (3 to 12 months) 
- In sustained remission (12 months or longer) 
- In a controlled environment
# Top 3 commonly used drugs in North America:
- Tobacco (about 25% of population) 
- Alcohol (about 15% of population) 
- Marijuana (about 5% of population)
# Pathways to Drug Dependence
- Experimentation
	- Most often in a social context
	- *No loss of control*
		- eg. Finite amount, only in certain situations, etc.
- Routine Use
	- Alterations to lifestyle and personal values
	- Borrowing, pawning, theft, lying, manipulation
	- *May still believe they have control*
- Addiction or Dependence
	- Efforts center on avoiding withdrawal symptoms
	- *Life is centered on getting the drug*
# DRUGS OF ABUSE
- **Depressants** : "Depress" CNS activity
	- Alcohol
		- Alcohol dehydrogenase is the enzyme to get rid of it
			- Low levels cause flushed face, high heart rate, increased effect
	- Barbituates
	- Opiates
-  **Stimulants** : Heighten CNS activity
	- Amphetamines
	- Cocaine
	- Nicotine
- **Hallucinogens** : distort sensory perceptions (e.g., *synesthesia*, colors, sounds, textures)
	- LSD
	- Phencyclidine (PCP)
	- Marijuana
- **Inhalants** : GABA effects
	- (GABA involved a lot in anxiety)
## Alcohol
### Risk factors for alcohol
- Risk factors for alcoholism
	- Gender
		- Rates about equal, but women start later and progress faster.
	- Age (starting before 40)
	- Antisocial Personality Disorder
	- Family history
		- Both heritable and modeling effects
	- Sociodemographic factors
		- Lower SES (socioeconomic status) and education, Indigenous > non-Indigenous
		- The damaging effects of alcohol abuse vary across ethnic groups in Canada, likely because of different cultural constraints and biological tolerance of alcohol.
### Alcohol details
- Conceptions of Alcoholism: Disease, Moral Defect, or Behaviour Pattern?
- Psychological Effects of Alcohol
	- Denial
	- Wet brain, Korsakoff's syndrome
		- Long term damage to brain and memory
	- delirium tremmens
		- 2-4 days after stopping heavy drinking
- Physical Health & Alcohol
	- Alcohol-induced Persisting Amnestic Disorder (aka Korsakoff's Syndrome)
		- Confusion, disorientation, recent memory loss
	- Malnutrition
	- FASD
- Moderate Drinking: Is There a Health Benefit?
	- (+) HDL
	- (-) Clotting Risk
	- 14/wk Men
	- 9/wk Women no more than 2 / day for either.
### Accidents
- Alcohol plays a role in deaths due to:
	- Snowmobile accidents: about 77% of cases
	- Homicides: over 50% of cases
	- Traffic Accidents: over 40% of cases
	- Boating accidents: about 40% of cases
	- Suicides: over 20% of cases
## Barbiturates
- Sedatives 
	- Mostly among middle aged adults 
	- Synergistic effect with alcohol (≈ 4x) 
	- Requires medically supervised withdrawal
## Opiates
- Intense rush
	- Narcotics
	- Analgesics
	- Endorphins
## Stimulants
- Cocaine
	- Snorted or injected
	- Often consumed in binges
	- Crack --> for smoking, fast, concentrated rush
	- Freebasing (heating with ether)
	- Effects of Cocaine
		- Birth defects
			- Auditory information processing
	- Sexual dysfunction 
	- (+) body temp, respiratory distress, appetite suppression
- Amphetamines
	- Amphetamine Psychosis
## Nicotine
- Nicotine Dependence
- Factors that play a role in cigarette smoking in Canada:
	- The prevalence of smoking among adults is higher among Aboriginal than non-Aboriginal people, regardless of whether they live rural or urban environments. 
	- Smoking is becoming increasingly concentrated among the poorer and less well-educated segments of the population.
## HALLUCINOGENS
- Named because of perceptual effects. 
- **Phencyclidine** (PCP)
	- Angel Dust 
		- Snorted
		- Reduce/Remove person's ability to experience pain
		- Creates beliefs of being invulnerable sometimes
- **Marijuana** 
	- Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)
		- Diathesis for psychosis can dramatically increase likelihood of drug induced psychosis
		- Like symptoms of schizophrenia
	- Hashish 
	- Higher level of **THC** leads to lower level of **CBD**
		- increased CBD *MAY* have a protective effect against TCH induced psychosis
- **Inhalants** 
	- DA and GABA effects
		- Solvents
		- Gasoline
		- Glue
# Mechanisms of Overdose
## 1) Effective vs Toxic Doses (Primarily Physiological)
- Tolerance to intoxicating effects to a drug and the lethal dose both increase over time. 
- Tolerance builds more quickly. 
	- Over time, the amount of drug necessary to produce the high gets closer and closer to the lethal dose level. 
	- **Neuroadaption:** Brain changes that take place over time to compensate for presence of foreign chemicals.
![[Pasted image 20240523154139.png]]
- Therapeutic (amount necessary to get high) curve moves to the right over time with drug use, toxic curve increases at a much slower rate
## 2) Compensatory Conditioning (Primarily Psychological)
- Over the course of conditioning, a CS may elicit physiological CRs that *oppose* the US (compensatory CRs). These CSs may include *contextual cues present during conditioning*. 
	- Eg., Cytochrome P450
		- Substance the body produces when exposed to toxin
		- Release can be conditioned using compensatory conditioning
- ==This contributes to withdrawal symptoms as well as tolerance.== 
- Siegel et al. (1982) suggested that a **failure** *to elicit such responses might play a part in drug overdose.*
	- **Phase 1:** *(Conditioning Trials)*
		- Two groups of rats were heroin addicted over 30 days. Three conditions: Same Room, Different Room.
		- Same and Different Room groups got heroin every second day, and a saline infusion on odd days. Saline and heroin were given in different rooms. 
	- **Phase 2:** *(Test day)*.
		- Same Room group: Got a double dose of heroin in the room where heroin was usually delivered.
		- Different Room group: Got double dose of heroin where they usually got saline. 
		- Control group: Never had heroin before but got a double dose.
	- **Results:** 
		- Same Room: 32% mortality 
		- Different Room: 64% mortality 
		- Controls : 100% mortality
		- ![[Pasted image 20240523160035.png|300]]
	- **Note:** CS’s (cues) for drug use will also frequently trigger cravings and withdrawal symptoms.
# THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES 
## Biological Perspectives
- Neurotransmitters 
	- Dopamine 
		- Drugs + schizophrenia = worse symptoms
			- Makes antipsychotic medication is way less effective until drugs go away
	- Brain’s Reward Centres
		- Mesolimbic pathway
		- nucleus acumbens
			- Entry point to prefrontal cortex
			- positive reinforcement when dopamine hits this area
			- prime area stimulated with drugs
- Genetic Factors 
	- Addictions tend to run in families 
- Alcohol dehydrogenase 
	- Enzyme
	- Ability to metabolize alcohol 
	- Genetic component
	- Flushing, nausea, intoxication at lower doses
## Learning Perspective
- Operant Conditioning
	- Alcohol & Tension Reduction
		- Alcohol = relaxing and good atmosphere
	- Negative Reinforcement & Withdrawal
		- delirium tremmens
		- cure negative reinforcement of withdrawal with alcohol
- The Conditioning Model of Cravings
	- Cues for substance use
- Observational Learning
	- equate alcohol consumption with maturity
## Cognitive Perspective
- Outcome Expectancies, Decision Making, & Substance
- Self-Efficacy Expectancies
- Does One Slip Cause People with Substance Abuse or Dependence to Go on Binges?
	- Abstinence violation effect (attribution to stable internal factors)
		- Slip up from a person causes 2 things
			- "I can't beat this alcoholism", "This treatment is pointless"
				- Internal belief, Core beleifs
			- Giving up
	- ![[Pasted image 20240523162909.png|500]]
		- Identically tasting drinks, given to two groups, one with alcohol, one with only tonic.
		- Tell half of each group that it is alcohol and half it is only tonic
		- **People who are told  they were given tonic, regardless of what they were actually given, drank less that those who were told they were given alcohol, regardless of what they were actually given**
		- **Expectation that you are drinking alcohol, triggers abstenance violation effect, and increases alcohol consumption**
- What You Believe is What You Get
	- Amount consumed is influenced by expectation of alcohol
	- Actual alcohol content didn't matter.
## Psychodynamic Perspectives
- Oral fixation
## Sociocultural Perspectives
- Both cultural and subcultural (eg., religion)
	- Being told it's normal and expected and "just what we do"
# Making changes / Treatment
![[Pasted image 20240523163502.png|400]]
- Prochaska & DiClemente (1983)
- **Transtheoretical in nature**.
- Has utility in most areas of psychotherapy, not just addictions.
	- Weight loss
	- Motivation
	- Exercise
	- CBT goals
- Has been operationalized in the URICA Scale
## Biological Approaches
- Detoxification
	- Not necessarily the hardest part
	- Physiological aspect of addiction is sorted out quickly
- Disulfiram (Antabuse)
	- In general, delay between consumption and withdrawal leads to a disruption in conditioned learning
	- So, Disulfiram makes the body extremely sick when consuming alcohol and therefore makes the person learn better
	- Leads to reduced time between drinking and negative effect
	- Requires person to stay on it and 
- Antidepressants
	- Reduces impulsiveness
	- If drinking is attributable to depressed psychological state, can help
- Nicotine Replacement Therapy
- Methadone Maintenance Programs
	- Methadone
	- Less high than heroin, 
- Naloxone & Naltrexone
	- *Antagonistic* to the opiates
	- Block the high from opiates
		- Lowers positive reinforcement
	- Poor long-term compliance
		- People just wanna get high
## Nonprofessional Support Groups
- Al-Anon
- Alcoholics Anonymous
- Very good for maintenance phase
- Reduces complacent attitudes
## Residential Approaches 
- Removing people from the environments that they use in
- Can have issues
	- When removing triggers or cues, they are absent and then the person doesn't get practice in using their coping strategies
## Psychodynamic Approaches
- Not used much at ALL
- Teach people relaxation skills
- Maintain motivation
## Behavioural Approaches
- Self-Control Strategies 
- Aversive Conditioning 
	- Early days involved shocks and images of people drinking
	- Most effective Aversive Conditioning type is to induce nausea
		- Easier than electric shocks for the brain to link with bad behaviour
- Social Skills Training
	- Resisting peer pressure
## Relapse-Prevention Training
![[Pasted image 20240523164018.png]]
- Pattern/high risk factor recognition
	- Predictability
	- Behaviours/thoughts/feelings
		- High risk situation has most of the time a combination
		- Predisposes a person to relapsing
		- Chains (see next slide)
	- Specific coping strategies
		- Escape/avoidance
	- Weekly "bring-backs"
	- SUDs
	- Abstinence Violation Effect
