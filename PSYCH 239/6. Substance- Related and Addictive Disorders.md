# Types
- DSM uses two major categories of substance-related disorders:
	- **Substance use disorders:** Patterns of *maladaptive behaviour involving the use of a psychoactive substance*. Substance-use disorders include *substance-abuse* disorders and *substance dependence* disorders. 
	- **Substance-induced disorders:** Disorders *induced by the use of psychoactive substances*, including intoxication, withdrawal syndromes, mood disorders, delirium, and amnesia.
	- Withdrawal symptoms are **OPOSITE** of the drug effect
- Other addictive disorders
	- Problem gambling behaviour was considered an *impulse control disorder* in former editions of the DSM. In DSM-5, *gambling disorder* is classified with other substance use disorders. Gambling disorder has commonalities in expression, causes, comorbidity, and treatment with substance use disorders. 
	- The broader category, though not formally mentioned in DSM is process addictions. – Partial exception is *Internet Gaming Disorder* (Conditions for further study: in Appendix 3)

# Hallmarks of Disordered Substance Use
- Tachycardia
- Delirium tremens
	- Alcohol causes disruption of *thymine* (vitamin B1)
	- tremens = shaky
	- delirium = symptoms of delirium
	- Very high quantities of alcohol over at least a month, and then stopping
	- treatment:
		- thymine (vitamin B1) supplements
		- other, non alcohol, CNS depressant
- Delirium
- Disorientation
- Physiological dependence (Addiction)
	- Tolerance
		- Consume more and more without getting the effect
	- Withdrawal
		- Body compensating causes opposite, unpleasant effects
- Psychological Dependence
	- Happens without actual Physiological dependence
