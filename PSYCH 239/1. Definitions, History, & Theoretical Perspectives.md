# Objectives
1. get familiar with the challenges of defining abnormal psychology
2. appreciate widespread nature if mental illness and risk factors
3. trace historical theoretical and scientific roots of abnormal psychology.
4. Review supernatural, biological, medical, psychological, sociological, and interactionist approaches to the understanding of abnormal behaviour.
# What is abnormal psychology?
"Abnormal psychology is the branch of the science of psychology that addresses the description, causes, and treatment of abnormal behaviour patterns." (Nevid et al., 2019, pg. 2)

# How do we define abnormal?
(First 3 are relative to culture)
1. is it unusual?
2. does the behavior violate social norms?
3. does it involve a faulty interpretation of reality?
4. does it cause personal distress?
5. is it maladaptive?
6. is it dangerous to the person or others?
- **This is all important in order for us to quantify "exactly" what abnormal behaviour is** 

# Factors affecting our label of abnormal
## Culture
- Normal in one culture may be abnormal in another culture
- Need to understand how different cultures experience different states of emotional distress, including depression and anxiety, rather than imposing out perspectives on them.
- Failure to recognize cultural differences can lead to inadequate and inappropriate treatment.
## Context
- Definition of abnormal behaviour depends a lot on context.
	- Shirtless with body paint at sports game vs. at church
# Why study it?
- Affects everyone in one way or another
- When abnormal behaviour involves a disturbance in functioning and behaviour, they are classified as **psychological disorders**
- 20% of Canadians will suffer from a psychological disorder in their lifetime
# How common?
- Anxiety: 30%
- Mood: 20%
- Substance Abuse: 15%
- *Any disorder: 46%*
# Risk Factors
- Age
- Education
- Childhood Trauma
- Current stress
- Life events
- Lack of social supports
- Gender
- Physical health
- Genetic Predisposition
## Details
- Exponentially increased effect when we have multiple risk factors
- Two risk factors can induce an 4x increase in adverse outcomes
- 4+ factors can induce 10x chance of mental disorder
# Historical views
## Demonological model
- **Demonological model:** *Not the person's fault, they are being inhabited/ controlled and they must be freed or remove the bad spiritual thing that is ailing them*
	- Not originating in Medieval times
	- Trephining: *Holes cut in the head in order to vent something out of the person, demon, spirit or something else.*

- Medieval Times
	- Demonological model
	- Exorcism
- Witchcraft
	- Malleus Maleficarum
		- *Maleficarum = gender neutral witch*
		- *Malleus = hammer*
		- This is a manual for "diagnosing" someone as a Maleficarum
		- people were often tortured when they were "found out"
		- Demonological model + control over those demons by the Maleficarum
		- Based a lot on finding a cause
## Medical Model
- **Medical Model:** *A normally functioning individual is not broken, an abnormally behaving individual has something broken in them and in order to treat we can fix that thing*

- Hippocrates & 'ill humors'
	- ![[Pasted image 20240507154931.png|200]]
	- Must balance the humors in order to "fix" someone
	- Abnormal behaviours are the result of underlying biological process.
		- Medical model
- Asylums in Europe & the New World
	- Bedlam, London UK
		- First Asylum for people with psychiatric disorders
		- People were not treated well
			- Starved
			- Sexually abused
			- Chained to parts of their cell
- The Reform Movement: Moral Therapy
	- Philippe Pinel (France), William Tuke (England) & Dorthea Dix (Canada & USA)
	- *"If these are Ill people, why would we be treating them this bad? We need to treat them like people, compassionately, and maybe they will improve"*
	- Resulted in putting people back in the community, built the field of occupational therapy
	- Eventually, these people were living on the streets as they were not given enough social support in life
- Treatment takes a step backwards
	- Mental institutions move to custodial care
- The Community Mental Health Movement in Canada
	- Canada Mental Health Association, 1963
	- Deinstitutionalization
	- Pharmacology & Phenothiazines
		- Phenothiazines - First generation antipsychotics, originally an insecticide, people who were exposed to this substance tended to calm down a lot
		- Then Used as an addition to anesthetic prior to surgery
		- THEN used as a treatment for the positive symptoms of Schizophrenia
		- THEN we realized the foggy, unclear thinking and delusions and hallucinations were also treated 
	- Psychiatric homeless
# Pathways to the present : From Demonological to Science
- Medical model:
	- Emil Kraepelin & Dementia praecox
- Psychological Models
	- Hypnosis and Hysteria: Charcot
		- Hysteria: *stupid understanding of women's psychology and a bias in diagnosis towards women lead to this concept*
	- Psychodynamic model & Catharsis: Freud
		- *"there is not necessarily a physical underlying issue with mental illness and therefore, non physical treatment can also be affective"*
- Sociocultural Model
	- Thomas Szasz: The Myth of Mental Illness
# Current perspectives on abnormal behaviour
- Biological perspectives 
- Psychological Perspectives
- Sociocultural Perspectives
- Interactionists Perspectives (Biopsychological)
## Biological Perspectives
- Bio vs medical model
	- We can adopt a biological oriented perspective without using the terminology of the medical model.
	- A focus on biological factors does not require the medical model.
## Genetics
- Genome: *All the genetic material encoded in DNA*
- DNA: *The molecular structure of the genome comprised of four organic compounds*
- Human genome: 2.8 billion base pairs, 20-25 thousand base pairs
- Genetic and Chromosomal disorders
- Epigenome
	- Ability to influence expression of genes
	- Inherited and induced (acetylation) gene regulation
- Stem Cells
# Nervous system
Neurons have:
- Soma 
- Dendrites
- Axon
- Terminals
- Knobs

- Certain neurotransmitters have a massive influence on certain psychiatric disorders
	- Dopamine hypothesis: Schizophrenia
	- Serotonin: Depression
		- Reuptake inhibitors (yippie)
			- SSRIS (Prozac)
# Which neurotransmitters play a role in psychological disorders?
- Excesses and deficiencies of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine have been connected with mood disorders and eating disorders
- Reduced levels of neurotransmitter acetylcholine is associated with Alzheimer's Disease
- Excessive levels of dopamine appear to be involved in schizophrenia
- Serotonin, another neurotransmitter, is linked to anxiety disorders, mood disorders, sleep disorders and eating disorders
# Psychological perspectives: Psychodynamic model
- Freud
- Psychoanalytic Theory
- The Structure of the mind
	- Unconscious
		- Not easy to access in your mind, cannot reach
	- Preconscious
		- Not aware of currently but easily accessible
	- Conscious
		- Currently in brain
	- Shitty understanding
- Gain insights into the unconscious mind from hearing what they have to say and then telling them what defense mechanisms that you need to get rid of
- ![[Pasted image 20240507163742.png]]
	- *Id:* Stupid, wants the most pleasure and the least pain, doesn't care about whatever else
	- *Ego:* refferee, makes peace between *Id* and *Super Ego*, maintains a peace bond between them
	- *Super Ego:* Learned from socialization, contains socialized values, fights *Id* in order to maintain normal function
	- Identification
		- Morally attach yourself to an important person in your life
		- Used by a person to match behaviour to said individual
		- When they fail at this, we must treat them
		- They need to regress psychologically in order for them to start doing the thing right and emulating proper behaviour
## Stages
1. Oral stage
	1. oral fixation
		- Can't control "consuming" impulses and this they need to work on that
		- alcoholism, stealing, binge eating
2. Anal Stage
	1. Analy Retentive Traits
		- Stuck up, not generous, Very Stingy, 
	2.  Anally expulsive traits
		- Can't stop, overly sharing, etc.
3. Phallic Stage
	1. Oedipus/Electra Complex
		- Means In love with opposite gender parent, wanna kill same gender parent
		- must Identify with same gender parent to fix it
	1. Castration anxiety
		- Get over this fear by identifying with same gender parent
4. Latency Stage
5. Genital Stage
	- Balanced and healthy way to regulate behaviours
## Defense mechanisms
![[Pasted image 20240507165129.png]]
- Most psychodynamic theorists, that aren't Freud, have something like this that is more simple
## More theorists
==These people care a hell of a lot less about Freud's crazy sex stuff==
- Carl Jung : Analytical Psychology
	- Archetypes
		- Genetically inherited
		- Persona
			- way we present ourselves outwardly to people
		- Shadow
			- sex, instinct, unconscious mind, repressed ideas, weaknesses, desires, instincts
		- Animus
			- Complimentary gender opposite of you
			- in eastern tradition, Yin and Yang
			- opposite gender "side" of a person
		- Self
			- Unified consciousness and unconsciousness
	- Collective unconscious
		- Shared with ancestors
- Alfred Adler
	- Inferiority complex
		- Feeling of inferiority about parts of us
		- we focus on it
	- drive to superiority
		- We wanna become superior
		- Use creative self to do this
		- Engaging in things that drive social behaviour and progress is the best way to do this
		- Focus on *social good*
	- Creative self
		- Ability to transform ourselves to escape inferiority
# Psychological perspectives: Behaviourism
## Modern behaviourism: Environmental Adaptation
![[Pasted image 20240507170629.png]]
- Pavlov
	- When dogs heard the bells from opening the door, the dogs began salivating a hell of a lot without actually giving them food yet
	- Conditioned stimulus evoked a conditioned response
	- Two things not normally linked in nature, are put together, so organism comes to expect one from the other
		- eg, traumatic event causes person to be anxious when entering a vehicle
		- brain goes "vehicle = Hurt and harmed"
		- PTSD
- Watson
	- Social processes can be reward or punishment
- Thorndike & Skinner
	- Classical conditioning (skinner boxes)
## Classical conditioning
- Conditioned response (CR)
- Unconditioned stimulus (US)
- Conditioned stimulus (CS)
- Unconditioned Response (UR)

Pavlov Setup
- ![[Pasted image 20240507171231.png|300]]
- Food happens no matter what, only association is established

![[Pasted image 20240507171428.png]]
## Operant Conditioning
- Reward only happens when positive behaviour is observed, association and *cause* can be established
- Reinforcement & reward
- Positive & Negative reinforcers (can be different for different people)
	- Positive: Appetitive stimulus, *Good thing added*
	- Negative:  *Bad thing removed*
- Primary & Secondary Reinforcers
	- Primary: Food, directly positive
	- Secondary: Money, can lead to 
- Positive Punishment & Negative Punishment
	- Positive: *bad thing added*
	- Negative: *removal of good thing*
## Social Cognitive Theory
- Albert Bandura
- Modelling & Expectancy
	- Bobo doll
	- Adult models behaviour interacting with doll in different ways
	- Adult is given feedback based on how they interacted with the doll, praise or punishment
	- Child is more likely to be aggressive if Adult is praised, less likely if adult is punished
	- *If we see aggression modeled, we may be more likely to engage in aggressive behaviour, depending on the social repercussions of modeled aggression*
	- This is called *vicarious reinforcement* and *social reinforcement*
- Social feedback can be rewards and punishments
- Reciprocity
	- *Not only am i influencing your behaviour, but you are influencing mine*
# Psychological perspectives: Humanistic Approach
- Humanistic-Existential Models
	- *Something inside us knows what we need to become the best version of ourselves and we should follow it*
	- Natural tendency for self improvement
- Carl Rogers
	- Self actualization
	- *"Left alone, in a healthy environment, humans develop into psychologically healthy beings"*
		- **Conditions of worth**
			- Things we put on people as expectations of how to behave and develop
			- Kids do what their parents want
			- If the parents are selectively approving of the child in certain situations and withdrawing it in other, they are creating **conditions of worth**
			- establishing these, the parent is fundamentally interfering with normal development of the child
			- shape of the child is dependent on external influences, such as parent or society (like a watermelon in the shape of a cube)
			- **Unconditional positive regard** = Normal development and psychologically healthy human
				- Not approving of everything the child does but kindly correcting them, in a healthy way
			- Not Living authentically causes a rift between them achieving self actualization and current state
- Abraham Maslow
	- Hierarchy of needs
		- Survival needs, then
		- More meaning oriented needs, then
		- Self Actualization
	- Living Authentically
- Les Greenberg
	- Emotional Intelligence
	- *People need to acknowledge their feelings, expressing them and working through them objectively, using it to guide out behaviour well*
# Psychological perspectives: Cognitive Perspective
- Information Processing Approaches
	- Interpretive Biases
- Albert Ellis
	- Activating events -> Beliefs -> Consequences
- Aaron Beck
	- Tripartite Model
		- triangle with thought, feelings and behaviour on vertexes
		- each vertex affects the other two
		- We have *very good control* over our *physical behaviour* directly
		- We have *decent control* over our *thoughts* directly
		- We have *very little control* over our *feelings* directly 
		- We can use our thoughts to modulate our *feeling* and *behaviour*
		- Big thoughts that change the way we interpret the world are called **Core beliefs**
	- Collaborative empiricism
		- Patient is colegue
			- Do a little experiment so show the patient that they are more capable than they seem
			- Practically challenge their core beliefs
		- Teach patient about the interpretation of their life
		- Figure out their core beliefs
		- eg. "I've had several failed relationships and therefore I won't ever have on in the future"
			- Core belief is **"I won't ever have on in the future"**
			- use **Collaborative empiricism** to challenge this idea and prove to the patient that their core beliefs are incorrect
			- generating empirical proof to show patient they are okay and the core beliefs that are messing them up are wrong
		- *Work on deconstructing logically incorrect ways of thinking and proving to the patient empirically that things are different than they seem*
- Donald Meichenbaum
	- Cognitive behaviour modification
		- Behaving in a way that provides ways of attaining more social reinforcement
		- more social reinforcement = better mood
- **Cognitive distortions**
	- ways of thinking that are not correct logically or out of proportion to actual scenario
	- selective abstraction,  overgeneralization, magnification and absolute thinking
# Psychological perspectives: Sociocultural Perspective
- social, cultural factors
	- ethnicity, gender, social roles, poverty
- *Abnormal behaviour may reside in failures of society rather than in the person*
-
