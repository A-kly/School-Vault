# Problems with Classification
- Undetermined reliability & validity
	- Competing info from different studies
	- Unifying set of characteristics between all categories
- Problems Distinguishing from other types of disorders
	- ASD vs schizotypal vs schizoeffective
- Overlap among disorders
- Difficulty in distinguishing between variations in normal & abnormal behaviour
- Sexist biases
# Proposes changes addressâ€¦
- Reduction in diagnostic overlap
- Less arbitrary diagnostic threshold
- Movement from a categorical to dimensional conceptualization
	- *Not Binary but on a scale*
- Recognition that symptom severity can fluctuate over time
- Alternatively, *movement to a dimensional (trait) model*:
	- A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning as manifested by difficulties **in two or more of the following areas**:
		1. Identity
			1. eg. Borderline personality disorder
		2. Self-direction
			1. Eg. Dependent personality disorder
		3. Empathy
			1. Eg. ASPD
		4. Intimacy
			1. Eg. Schizo / ASD
	- B. One or more pathological personality trait domains OR specific trait facets within domains, considering ALL of the following domains:
		1. Negative Affectivity (vs Emotional Stability)
			- Intense, unstable emotions
		2. Detachment (vs Extraversion)
			- Withdrawal, restricted affect, social avoidance
		3. Antagonism (vs Agreeableness)
			- Behaving in a way that invites/produces conflict, including criminality
		4. Disinhibition (vs Conscientiousness)
			- Seeking immediate gratification
		5. Psychoticism (vs Lucidity)
			- Unusual, culturally-inappropriate behaviour
	- *Severity of each is rated on a scale from 0 to 4 on the basis of impairment*.
- **Probably** 6 PDs will survive into the next version of DSM
	- Antisocial/Psychopathic
	- Avoidant
	- Borderline
	- Narcissistic
	- Obsessive-Compulsive
	- Schizotypal
# Theoretical Perspectives
- Psychodynamic Perspective
	- Heinz Kohut
		- Self psychology
		- Mostly on narcissistic personality
			- Lack of empathy development
				- Causes Only self focussed behaviour
	- Otto Kernberg
		- Mostly BPD
		- "People never learned to tolerate gray shades"
			- Unable to have an okay state
		- **Splitting**
			- All good vs All bad (how they view the world)
				- Eg. splitting up treatment team into "good doctors" and "bad doctors" and treating them well vs bad
			- Splitting up people into groups (how they affect the world)
	- Margaret Mahler
		- Also emphasized BPD
		- Symbiotic
			- Deep concern with abandonment.
			- Relationships are often incredibly symbiotic, mother and child for example.
				- Child grows up believing that they they need someone to be with them always
				- Cannot develop own identity
			- Developing codependency, and causes relationship disruption when 
		- Separation-individuation
- Learning Perspectives
	- Reinforcement history
	- "The behaviour this person is showing, is a reflection of their conditioning history"
	- eg. ASPD
		- Only way the child can get resources is to take from others
		- So the kid learns this
		- It becomes reinforced
		- Continues into adulthood
- Family Perspectives
	- Parenting styles and personality
- Cognitive-Behavioural Perspectives
	- Problem-solving therapy
- Biological Perspectives
	- Genetic Factors
		- Twin Studies
	- Neuropsychological Factors
		- Differences in prefrontal cortex in ASPD
		- Gray: Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST)
			- People are more sensitive to certain reinforcement
			- We change our behaviour to produce a response that we like
- Sociocultural Views
	- SES, *trauma*, parenting style, cultural norms (less important, cut across cultural boundaries)
# Treatment
- These conditions are highly refractory!
	-  Difficult for the patient to see, therefore limited insight.
	-  Inherent stability of personality
- Treatment is different for various PDs
- "Stepped care" model
	- Start by giving some mild advice, informal
	- if the patient needs it, increase the amount of aid given until we reach what we need
***
- Psychodynamic Approaches
	- Insight re historical basis
	- Insight re how their interpersonal conduct undermines relationships
- Cognitive Behavioural Approaches
	- Conceptual personality as persistent behaviour patterns established and maintained by Rf contingencies
	- General strategy is to utilize modelling, Rf, and extinction to replace maladaptive behaviours
	- Can utilize social skills training, identification of distorted beliefs, coaching family members
- Biological Approaches
	-  Limited contribution
	-  Impulsiveness and low affect may reflect serotonin deficiencies, therefore try SSRIs
- Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)
	-  Developed primarily for BPD
	- BPD patients habitually "test" relationships
		- Frequent crises
		- Unscheduled phone calls
		- Suicide threats/attempts
		- "Splitting" professional teams and social groups
		- Caregiver "burnout"
	- mindfulness techniques
	- distress tolerance
	- emotion regulation strategies
	- interpersonal effectiveness
	- Usually team-delivered two full days/week
