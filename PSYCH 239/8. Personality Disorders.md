- Problems Distinguishing from other types of disorders
	- ASD vs schizotypal vs schizoeffective
- Overlap among disorders
- Difficulty in distinguishing between variations in normal & abnormal behaviour
- Sexist biases
# Proposes changes addressâ€¦
- Reduction in diagnostic overlap
- Less arbitrary diagnostic threshold
- Movement from a categorical to dimensional conceptualization
	- *Not Binary but on a scale*
- Recognition that symptom severity can fluctuate over time
- Alternatively, *movement to a dimensional (trait) model*:
	- A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning as manifested by difficulties **in two or more of the following areas**:
		1. Identity
			1. eg. Borderline personality disorder
		2. Self-direction
			1. Eg. Dependent personality disorder
		3. Empathy
			1. Eg. ASPD
		4. Intimacy
			1. Eg. Schizo / ASD

# Theoretical Perspectives
- Psychodynamic Perspective
	- Heinz Kohut
		- Self psychology
		- Mostly on narcissistic personality
			- Lack of empathy development
				- Causes Only self focussed behaviour
	- Otto Kernberg
		- Mostly BPD
		- "People never learned to tolerate gray shades"
			- Unable to have an okay state
		- **Splitting**
			- All good vs All bad (how they view the world)
				- Eg. splitting up treatment team into "good doctors" and "bad doctors" and treating them well vs bad
			- Splitting up people into groups of good or bad (how they affect the world)
