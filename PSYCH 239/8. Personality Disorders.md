# Objectives
1. Become familiar with the 10 personality disorders (PDs) defined in the DSM-5 
	-  Core features of each (by cluster) 
	- Differential features 
2. Understand the problems with the current PDs, and how they may be addressed in future versions of the DSM. 
3. Understand the theoretical perspectives pertaining to the various PDs and the methods of Tx that stem from those 
4. Gain a more in-depth understanding of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
# WHAT ARE PERSONALITY DISORDERS?
- All of us have particular styles of behaviour and ways of relating to others. Some of us are shy; others more social. Some of us are orderly; others sloppy.
- When these behaviour patterns become so inflexible or maladaptive that they cause significant personal distress or impair functioning in the social or occupational realms, their behaviour pattern may be diagnosed as a personality disorder.
- Types of abnormal behaviour patterns involving excessively rigid patterns of behaviour or ways of relating to others that ultimately become self-defeating because their rigidity prevents adjustment to external demands.
# TYPES OF PERSONALITY DISORDERS
- **Ego Syntonic:** Behaviour or feelings that are perceived as natural or compatible parts of the self. 
	- "It's just who i am"
- **Ego Dystonic:** Behaviour or feelings that are perceived to be foreign or alien to one’s self-identity.
	- "This isn't who i am, not part of me, bothersome"
# General DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria
- A. An enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that *deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture*. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas:
	- (1) *cognition* (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events)
	- (2) *affectivity* (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response)
	- (3) *interpersonal functioning*
	- (4) *impulse control*
- B. The *enduring pattern* is *inflexible and pervasive* across a broad range of personal and social situations.
- C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant *distress or impairment* in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
- D. The pattern is *stable and of long duration* and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood.
- E. The enduring pattern is *not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder*.
- F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma).
***
- ==Most of these are very hard to treat because they are Ego Syntonic. And we see these features of personality as who we are, they are essentially invisible to us. And the person who has they doesn't care.==
# THE THREE CLUSTERS
- A) Odd, eccentric behaviour “Mad” 
	- Paranoid 
	- Schizoid 
	- Schizotypal 
- B) Dramatic, emotional, impulsive “Bad” 
	- Borderline 
	- Antisocial 
	- Narcissistic 
	- Histrionic 
- C) Anxious, fearful, avoidant “Sad” 
	- Avoidant 
	- Dependent 
	- Obsessive-Compulsive
- **Important to keep in mind:** 
	- Many (if not most) PD Dx are “PDNOS” 
	- They can fluctuate in their intensity over time 
	- Make no mistake about it, these can be highly debilitating disorders. They are not just somebody choosing to be nasty (with the possible exception of ASPD)
# Cluster A
- Personality Disorders Characterized by Odd or Eccentric Behaviour (‘Mad’)
## Paranoid Personality Disorder
- Type of personality disorder characterized by **persistent suspiciousness of the motives of others**, but not to the point of holding clear-cut delusions 
- *Tendency to cast opinions in a certain direction*
- *Lack of trust*
- Core features
	- Suspiciousness without due cause
	- Preoccupations with unfounded concerns over *lack of loyalty* of friends, spouse, and family
	- Emotionally closed
		- reluctant to confide or 'open up'
	- Interpretive biases that promotes perception of innocuous content as threatening
	- grudging
- Hard to treat due to lack of trust in therapist. Difficulty establishing Therapeutic alliance
	- Interpretive biases causing therapist to become a subject of hostility
- eg. The guy who thought the office was conspiring to get rid of him
	- His keycard wasn't working
	- Confronted boss aggressively
	- everyone was having a similar problem but he was paranoid
## Schizoid Personality Disorder
- Type of personality disorder characterized by a *persistent lack of interest in social relationships, flattened affect, and social withdrawal*.
- Looks like some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, not psychosis. 
- *rarely express emotions and are distant and aloof*. 
	- But emotions of people with schizoid personalities are not as shallow or blunted as they are in people with schizophrenia.
- Core features 
	- *No interest in, or enjoyment of, close relationships* 
	- *Chronic loner* 
	- No interest in sex 
		- May masturbate to weird porn
	- Seldom participates in recreational activities 
	- *Unaffected by praise or criticism* 
	- Emotionally cold, detached, flat
- Hard to help in therapy because this person is extremely hard to connect to
## Schizotypal Personality Disorder
- Type of personality disorder characterized by *eccentricities or oddities of thought and behaviour but without clearly psychotic features*. Similar to Sz in many respects but without the profound impairment in reality testing.
- No reality impairment but similar to the other positive symptoms of schizophrenia
	- Thoughts that media is trying to communicate sometimes
	- Thoughts that people are talking about you
- Core features 
	- Ideas of reference 
	- *Odd beliefs / magical thinking (not just superstitions)* 
		- I can make things happen just by thinking of them
			- eg. thinking about something can lead to bad things happening when angry

		- ghosts?
		- How often do they encounter an experience that they cannot explain
	- Peculiar thinking and speech 
	- Suspicious/paranoid 
	- Social isolation (other than family) 
	- Persistent social anxiety
- *Lots of Externalizing behaviour, directing problems outwards*
# Cluster B
- Personality Disorders Characterized by Dramatic, Emotional, or Erratic Behaviour (‘Bad’)
## Antisocial Personality Disorder (and Psychopathy)
- Type of personality disorder characterized by a chronic pattern of antisocial and irresponsible behaviour and lack of remorse.
- Core features 
	- Failure to conform to social and legal norms 
	- Lying / conning 
	- Impulsivity and short sightedness in planning 
	- Irritability / aggressiveness. Fighting 
	- Recklessness with self and others 
	- Irresponsibility 
	- Lack of remorse 
	- ==Note: MUST be 18 and have shown signs of Conduct Disorder before 15 years of age==
	- ==Note: Only personality disorder that CANNOT be diagnosed pre age 18==
### PSYCHOPATHY
- Not a separate DSM PD.
	- *An extreme case of ASPD only about 30% of ASPD cases*
	- *80% of people with PSYCHOPATHY would also have the criteria for ASPD*
- Type of personality pattern characterized by affective and interpersonal traits, *such as shallow emotions, selfishness, arrogance, superficial charm, deceitfulness, manipulativeness, irresponsibility, sensation-seeking, and a lack of empathy, anxiety, and remorse, combined with persistent violations of social norms, a socially deviant and nomadic lifestyle, and impulsiveness*.
	- Dopamine = pleasure = short lived
		- Main mechanism behind addiction
	- Serotonin = content = calm = fulfilled
		- Main mechanism behind persistent positive mental state
	- **Difficult to determine an actual lack of remorse, as they have likely thought about it a lot**
	- Complete insincere reactions, they claim they cannot forgive themselves but believe their victim absolutely should forgive them
	- Some believe their victims should be grateful due to insurance payout or other things similar
- Not all criminals show signs of psychopathy. 
	- Not all ASPD patients are psychopaths either!
- Some controversy around the notion of a **successful psychopath**
	- Must distinguish between Factor I and Factor II PCL-R features
		- Factor 1: interpersonal issues and affective issues
			- "selfish, callous and remorseless use of others"
		- Factor 2: Criminal activity
			- "chronically unstable, antisocial and socially deviant lifestyle"
	- Appreciate that one can have strong (Factor I) features without being a psychopath.
		- *May be nominally law-abiding and successful in their chosen occupations, but still show callous disregard for the interests and feelings of others*.
- Antisocial personality disorder cuts across all racial and ethnic groups.
- Researchers find no evidence of ethnic or racial differences in the rates of the disorder
- There are several psychophysiological and biological factors that are related to antisocial personality and psychopathy:
	- Lack of emotional responsiveness
		- Even to learned pain / punishment
	- The craving-for-stimulation model
		- Somewhat like ADHD, minus the sense of responsibility and remorse
	- Lack of restraint on impulsivity
	- Limbic abnormalities
		- Positive punishment often Fails to make them  learn from experiences and does not have a tendency to reduce bad behaviour, **Negative punishment does though**
- ==Sociopathy is considered another section of ASPD==
## BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER
- Primarily characterized by a pervasive pattern of *==instability== in relationships, self-image, and mood and a ==lack of control over impulses==*. People with BPD tend to be *uncertain* about their **values, goals, loyalties, careers, choices of friends, and perhaps even sexual orientations**
- Three dialectical dilemmas (Linehan) (Things BPD people struggle with)
	- emotional vulnerability versus self-invalidation
		- Very vulnerable and unstable emotionally (fear of abandonment and rejection) but also unable to accept reassurances and unable realize that they can be effective in social situations
	- active passivity versus apparent competence
		- Going out of your way to do nothing vs coming across socially as being very artificially socially confident
		- "Here are a list of things that you have clearly laid out, and we have talked about why they may help you. Why aren't you doing them??"

		- Self harm
		- Intoxicants
		- Suicide attempts
	- Other person stops responding as much to larger crises
		- Crises become larger, more drawn out, more dramatic and intense
	- Eventually, extinction burst happens and person may succeed in killing themselves

## Antisocial Personality Disorder (and Psychopathy)

## Avoidant Personality Disorder

# Problems with Classification
- Undetermined reliability & validity
	- Competing info from different studies
	- Unifying set of characteristics between all categories
- Problems Distinguishing from other types of disorders
	- ASD vs schizotypal vs schizoeffective
- Overlap among disorders
- Difficulty in distinguishing between variations in normal & abnormal behaviour
- Sexist biases
# Proposes changes address…
- Reduction in diagnostic overlap
- Less arbitrary diagnostic threshold
- Movement from a categorical to dimensional conceptualization
	- *Not Binary but on a scale*
- Recognition that symptom severity can fluctuate over time
- Alternatively, *movement to a dimensional (trait) model*:
	- A. Moderate or greater impairment in personality functioning as manifested by difficulties **in two or more of the following areas**:
		1. Identity
			1. eg. Borderline personality disorder
		2. Self-direction
			1. Eg. Dependent personality disorder
		3. Empathy
			1. Eg. ASPD
		4. Intimacy
			1. Eg. Schizo / ASD
	- B. One or more pathological personality trait domains OR specific trait facets within domains, considering ALL of the following domains:
		1. Negative Affectivity (vs Emotional Stability)
			- Intense, unstable emotions
		2. Detachment (vs Extraversion)
			- Withdrawal, restricted affect, social avoidance
		3. Antagonism (vs Agreeableness)
			- Behaving in a way that invites/produces conflict, including criminality
		4. Disinhibition (vs Conscientiousness)
			- Seeking immediate gratification
		5. Psychoticism (vs Lucidity)
			- Unusual, culturally-inappropriate behaviour
	- *Severity of each is rated on a scale from 0 to 4 on the basis of impairment*.
- **Probably** 6 PDs will survive into the next version of DSM
	- Antisocial/Psychopathic
	- Avoidant
	- Borderline
	- Narcissistic
	- Obsessive-Compulsive
	- Schizotypal
# Theoretical Perspectives
- Psychodynamic Perspective
	- Heinz Kohut
		- Self psychology
		- Mostly on narcissistic personality
			- Lack of empathy development
				- Causes Only self focussed behaviour
	- Otto Kernberg
		- Mostly BPD
		- "People never learned to tolerate gray shades"
			- Unable to have an okay state
		- **Splitting**
			- All good vs All bad (how they view the world)
				- Eg. splitting up treatment team into "good doctors" and "bad doctors" and treating them well vs bad
			- Splitting up people into groups (how they affect the world)
	- Margaret Mahler
		- Also emphasized BPD
		- Symbiotic
			- Deep concern with abandonment.
			- Relationships are often incredibly symbiotic, mother and child for example.
				- Child grows up believing that they they need someone to be with them always
				- Cannot develop own identity
			- Developing codependency, and causes relationship disruption when 
		- Separation-individuation
- Learning Perspectives
	- Reinforcement history
	- "The behaviour this person is showing, is a reflection of their conditioning history"
	- eg. ASPD
		- Only way the child can get resources is to take from others
		- So the kid learns this
		- It becomes reinforced
		- Continues into adulthood
- Family Perspectives
	- Parenting styles and personality
- Cognitive-Behavioural Perspectives
	- Problem-solving therapy
- Biological Perspectives
	- Genetic Factors
		- Twin Studies
	- Neuropsychological Factors
		- Differences in prefrontal cortex in ASPD
		- Gray: Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST)
			- People are more sensitive to certain reinforcement
			- We change our behaviour to produce a response that we like
- Sociocultural Views
	- SES, *trauma*, parenting style, cultural norms (less important, cut across cultural boundaries)
# Treatment
- These conditions are highly refractory!
	-  Difficult for the patient to see, therefore limited insight.
	-  Inherent stability of personality
- Treatment is different for various PDs
- "Stepped care" model
	- Start by giving some mild advice, informal
	- if the patient needs it, increase the amount of aid given until we reach what we need
***
- Psychodynamic Approaches
	- Insight re historical basis
	- Insight re how their interpersonal conduct undermines relationships
- Cognitive Behavioural Approaches
	- Conceptual personality as persistent behaviour patterns established and maintained by Rf contingencies
	- General strategy is to utilize modelling, Rf, and extinction to replace maladaptive behaviours
	- Can utilize social skills training, identification of distorted beliefs, coaching family members
- Biological Approaches
	-  Limited contribution
	-  Impulsiveness and low affect may reflect serotonin deficiencies, therefore try SSRIs
		- Low affect can be helped by these
- Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)
	-  Developed primarily for BPD
	- BPD patients habitually "test" relationships
		- Frequent crises
		- Unscheduled phone calls
		- Suicide threats/attempts
			- **Extinction burst**
				- Rat in operant conditioning chamber and teach to press button for reward
				- Then set it so that rat has to press button 10 times for food.
				- Rat presses button once, nothing happens, rat repeatedly presses button until food is rewarded
				- *"When you are on a reinforcement schedule, the tendency to engage in behaviour that usually leads to reinforcement, increases in rate and intensity"*
				- **This teaches a person to be persistent**, the level of intensity of behaviour must be increased in order to receive support.
		- "Splitting" professional teams and social groups
		- Caregiver "burnout"
	- mindfulness techniques
		- being able to describe feelings without encouraging maladaptive actions
	- distress tolerance
		- Positive things we can do to calm down / cope
	- emotion regulation strategies
		- Eastern philosophies
	- interpersonal effectiveness
		- Learn a core set of social skills
	- Usually team-delivered two full days/week
	- **Focus on not "buying into" the forced responsibility of the patient**
