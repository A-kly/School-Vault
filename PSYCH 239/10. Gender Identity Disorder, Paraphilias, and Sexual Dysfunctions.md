-  Attitudes towards sexual activity are incredibly diverse. 
-  What is ‘normal’ is clearly influenced by sociocultural factors. 
-  Sexual behaviour may be labeled as abnormal if it: 
	-  deviates from the norms of one’s society. 
	-  is self-defeating/causes personal distress 
	-  harms others 
	-  interferes with one’s ability to function 
-  Examples of each?

- Gender reassignment. Chastity Bono, left; Chaz Bono, right, in 2011. Bono had Gender Dysphoria and underwent hormone and surgical procedures to transition from anatomical female to male.
## DSM-5 Criteria: Gender Dysphoria (Adult & Adolescent)

-  A. A *marked incongruence* between one’s experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months’ duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: 
	1. A marked incongruence between one’s *experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics* (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 
	2. A strong *desire to be rid* of one’s primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one’s experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). 
	3. A strong *desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender*. 
	4. A strong *desire to be of the other gender* (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender).
	5. A strong desire to be *treated as the other gender* (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender). 
	6. A *strong conviction* that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one’s assigned gender). 
- B. The condition is associated with clinically *significant distress* or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning.
- **Specify if:** *Post-transition:* The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen—namely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natural female).
## GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER 
- **Gender Expression:**
	- The way one presents their gender outwardly.
- **Gender Identity:**
	- One’s psychological sense of being female or male or between or none.
- **Gender Dysphoria**
	- A disorder in which the individual believes that her or his anatomic gender is inconsistent with his or her psychological sense of being male or female.
## Treatment
- Hormone therapy
	- Lots of options
	- Controversial (calm down lmao)
	- Puberty blockers for under 18
		- Can have issues for fertility if stopped'
	- Withholding treatment can cause lasting psychological damage as well
- Living as the identified gender ≈ 1 year (RLE; Real Life Experience) 
	- Very often challenged
	- Legal requirement of 18 years or older or consent from parent
	- Legally use gendered washrooms they identify with
	- Requirement for surgery often (Depends on region)
- Sex reassignment surgery 
	- tracheal shave
	- Breast removal/construction
	- Vaginoplasty
		- Surgical removal of the penis and creation of a vagina
		- Outer shaft skin kept and turned into canal
		- Glands skin turned into clitoris / implanted deeper
		- Dilation required (ouch (??))
	- Phalloplasty
		- Clitoris embedded in shaft of penis created from skin taken from thigh or forearm
		- Normal size penis, erection achieved via prosthesis
		- Two different ways to make erect
			- implanted Malleable metal rods to bend into place
			- Implanted hydraulic erection system
	- Metoidioplasty
		- Vaginal lining is scraped and allowed to heal together to seal closed 
		- Alternative to phalloplasty 
		- Starts with hormone therapy to enlarge clitoris to about 5 cm 
		- Labia are fashioned into a scrotum, usually with prosthetic testicles 
		- Clitoris located at end; maintains orgasmic capacity
		- Higher levels of satisfaction than phalloplasty
- Psychotherapy 
	- Necessary throughout 
	- Important to screen for other conditions motivating the desire for gender change 
	- Since these are major, and partly irreversible surgeries, the decision to move forward should be made cautiously 
	- Excessive delays/refusal can also be risk factors
	- Other mental health conditions leading to identity disruption potentially
		- BPD
		- Schizophrenia (inhabited by a different gendered spirit)
	- Not giving support can lead to a LOT of psychological harm
### Please be aware…
- Gender transformation is a lifelong process: It neither begins nor ends with surgery
- Not every transgendered person will opt for the full range of affirming surgeries. They could conceivably choose whatever subset they feel best resolves their gender dysphoria.
	- For many, this may mean no surgeries or hormones at all.
# PARAPHILIC DISORDER
- Not all of them are problematic
## Too many to count…
- Exhibitionistic 
- Fetishistic 
- Transvestic 
	- Not to be confused with GD 
- Voyeuristic 
- Frotteuristic 
- Toucheristic 
- Klismaphilic 
- Pedophilic
## The Development of Persistent Sexual Offending Against Children
- 2 components: 
	- Antisociality 
	- Sexual attraction to prepubescent children (pedophilia)
- The presence of both significantly increases likelihood that a person will offend against children
## DSM-5 Criteria (Eg., Exhibitionistic Disorder)
- A. Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the exposure of one’s genitals to an unsuspecting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. 
- B. The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. 
	- Specify whether: 
		- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children 
		- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to physically mature individuals 
		- Sexually aroused by exposing genitals to prepubertal children and to physically mature individuals
	- Specify if;
		- In a controlled environment: This specifier is primarily applicable to individuals living in institutional or other settings where opportunities to expose one’s genitals are restricted.
		- In full remission: The individual has not acted on the urges with a nonconsenting person, and there has been no distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, for at least 5 years while in an uncontrolled environment.
## ASSESSMENT OF EROTIC PREFERENCE

- Primary means is by patient self-report, though this is highly prone to distortion, especially when motivated by shame or possible legal censure. 
- Examining web browsing history. 
- VRT 
	- Indirect. Based on viewing times and pattern
	- Abel battery: 
		- Also elicits a subjective rating from 1 (disgusting) to 7 (highly arousing)
		- Not always accepted in court 
- Plethysmographic studies – More direct. Measurement of arousal while watching/hearing stimuli in several categories.
