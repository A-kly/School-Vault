# What is a process?
- A *process* is a program in execution
- Components:
	- program to be executed
	- data on which the program will execute
	- CPU resurces (registers)
	- data resources required by the program (memory & files)
	- status of the execution
# Program vs Process
Are they the same?? ***NO***
- **It can be More:** a program is just part of a process context. tar can be executed by two different people, same program (shared code) as part of different processes.
- **It can be less:** a program may invoke several processes. cc invokes cpp, cc1, cc2, as, and ld.
