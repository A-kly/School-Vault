# Procedural vs Declarative Programming vs Constraint Programming
- Procedural
	- Step by step instructions, programmer specifies control flow
- Declarative
	- Specify the logic of program, ,let program figure out steps on it's own
	- Logic programming is a declarative style. It can lead to very short and elegant programs
	- Prolog is by far the most popular logical programming language
	- In Constraint Programming you specify constraints on the solution, then let a solver find solutions
# Course goals
- Introduce major nonprocedural programming paradigms
	- Functional programming with lisp
	- Logic Programming with Prolog
	- Constraint Programming using an extension of prolog
