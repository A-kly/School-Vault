# Procedural vs Declarative Programming vs Constraint Programming
- Procedural
	- Step by step instructions, programmer specifies control flow
- Declarative
	- Specify the logic of program, ,let program figure out steps on it's own
	- Logic programming is a declarative style. It can lead to very short and elegant programs
	- Prolog is by far the most popular logical programming language
	- In Constraint Programming you specify constraints on the solution, then let a solver find solutions
# Course goals
- Introduce major nonprocedural programming paradigms
	- Functional programming with lisp
	- Logic Programming with Prolog
	- Constraint Programming using an extension of prolog
- Understand the foundations of functional and logical programming
- Be able to use these ideas, even in other languages, for solving practical problemms
- Answer set programming for computationally hard programs
# Course organization
- 4 assignments (36%)
- Midterm (80 minutes, in class) Feb 27 (24%)
- Final (3 hours) Current: April 19th 2:00pm (40%)
- Assignments are individual, discussion permitted, no code sharing, must understand submission
- Must not post assignment problems anywhere to seek solutions
- ==He recommends not using LLMs and just working on the stuff myself to learn better==
