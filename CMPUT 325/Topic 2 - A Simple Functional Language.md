# Fun - A simple functional Language
- A program in the `Fun` language is a collection of functions
- Functions defined over lists and atoms
- computations = functions evaluated on argument(s)
- math like syntax (for now)
>[!example]
> `f (x, y) = x âˆ— x + y`
> - The symbol = is read as is defined as
> - f(x,y) is called the lefthand side
> - The function definition is on the righthand side
