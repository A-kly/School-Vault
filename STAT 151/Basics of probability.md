# Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics
- If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is extremely small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.
- eg. 
	- Under the assumption of a fair coin, if we get 98 heads out of 100 flips, we have to reject the assumption that the coin is a fair coin.
- Statisticians use the rare event rule for inferential statistics.

# Basic Concepts of Probability
- An **experiment** (or a random process) is an action *whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty*.
- Eg.
	- Tossing a coin
	- Randomly selecting a card from 52 playing cards
	- Drawing a lottery ticket
	- Selecting a sample

- An **event** (denoted by A, B, C) is any *collection of results or outcomes of an experiment*.
	- eg. Getting at least one head in tossing a coin twice. i.e. {HH, HT, TH}
- A **simple event** is an outcome or an event that *cannot be further broken down into simpler components*.
	- eg. Getting two heads in tossing a coin twice (i.e. {HH}) is a simple event.
	- Getting at least one head in tossing a coin twice (i.e. {HH, HT, T H}) is **not a simple event**.
- The **sample space** for a procedure consists of all possible simple events.
	- eg. The collection of all 52 cards is the sample space in randomly selecting a card in a deck of 52 playing cards.
## Interpretations of P(A)
==Notation: Probability of event A is denoted by P (A).==
- The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times. ![[Pasted image 20230927101559.png]]
