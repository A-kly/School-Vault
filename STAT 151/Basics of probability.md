# Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics
- If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is extremely small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.
- eg. 
	- Under the assumption of a fair coin, if we get 98 heads out of 100 flips, we have to reject the assumption that the coin is a fair coin.
- Statisticians use the rare event rule for inferential statistics.

# Basic Concepts of Probability
- An **experiment** (or a random process) is an action *whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty*.
- Eg.
	- Tossing a coin
	- Randomly selecting a card from 52 playing cards
	- Drawing a lottery ticket
	- Selecting a sample

- An **event** (denoted by A, B, C) is any *collection of results or outcomes of an experiment*.
	- 
- A **simple event** is an outcome or an event that *cannot be further broken down into simpler components*.
