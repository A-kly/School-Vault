# Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics
- If, under a given assumption, the probability of a particular observed event is extremely small, we conclude that the assumption is probably not correct.
- eg. 
	- Under the assumption of a fair coin, if we get 98 heads out of 100 flips, we have to reject the assumption that the coin is a fair coin.
- Statisticians use the rare event rule for inferential statistics.

# Basic Concepts of Probability
- An **experiment** (or a random process) is an action *whose outcome cannot be predicted with certainty*.
- Eg.
	- Tossing a coin
	- Randomly selecting a card from 52 playing cards
	- Drawing a lottery ticket
	- Selecting a sample

- An **event** (denoted by A, B, C) is any *collection of results or outcomes of an experiment*.
	- eg. Getting at least one head in tossing a coin twice. i.e. {HH, HT, TH}
- A **simple event** is an outcome or an event that *cannot be further broken down into simpler components*.
	- eg. Getting two heads in tossing a coin twice (i.e. {HH}) is a simple event.
	- Getting at least one head in tossing a coin twice (i.e. {HH, HT, T H}) is **not a simple event**.
- The **sample space** for a procedure consists of all possible simple events.
	- eg. The collection of all 52 cards is the sample space in randomly selecting a card in a deck of 52 playing cards.
	- *Box part in a vein diagram*
## Interpretations of P(A)
==Notation: Probability of event A is denoted by P (A).==
- The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times. ![[Pasted image 20230927101559.png]]
## Law of Large Number
As a random process is repeated again and again, the relative frequency probability of an event tends to approach the actual probability.
- **Example:** In a large number of fair coin tosses, one can get approximately half heads H and half tails T.
	- But this should not be misunderstood that random processes are supposed to compensate for whatever happened in the past (called Gambler’s fallacy or law of averages).
## Properties of Probability
1. The probability of an event that can not occur (impossible event) is 0.
2. The probability of an event that is certain to occur is 1.
3. For any event A, the probability of A is between 0 and 1 inclusive. i.e 0 ≤ P (A) ≤ 1
## Disjoint Events (Mutually exclusive events)
Events A and B are **disjoint** (or mutually exclusive) if they *cannot occur at the same time*.

### Examples of disjoint events
- In a coin toss, the events {H} and {T } are disjoint.
- A student can not fail and pass a course.
- A single card drawn from a deck cannot be an ace and a queen.
