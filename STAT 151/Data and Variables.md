# Statistics Process
Goal: to take a sample of a very large population, Analyze and come to conclusion about the full population
## Descriptive Statistics
- Gathering data
- Summarize and present the data
	- *Summarize:** Mean, standard dev, median
	- *Present:* Histogram, graphs, tables
- Analyze and interpret the data
	- What does the data (median, mean, standard deviation, histogram) mean?
## Inferential statistics
- Make generalisations of the population

# Data types
## Categorical
No granularity, only categories	

- **Nominal**: No method to compare between categories, we have simply given *Names* to categories
	- Eg: Gender, Blood type
- **Ordinal**: We can made an order to each category, One observation/category comes before (or is better than) another category
	- Eg: Letter grades
- **Center of data:** Mode
### Nominal vs Ordinal
Ask: Is one data better than another?
- Phone area code -> Number is not ordered -> Nominal
## Numerical
No distinct categories, more continuous

- **Discrete**: described with *integers* only
	- Counted, not measured
	- eg: \# of customers
- **Continuous**: Fractions of a unit are allowed
	- Measured, not counted
	- Eg: Height
- **Center of data**: Mean, Median
## Categorical vs Numerical
Ask: Does the data descibe a category or a value?
- Phone area code -> Category of location ->Categorical
# Sampling
**Good sample data**: Small, representative subset of population, random sampling
**Bias**: Result of non-representative sample
## 5 Ws of Sampling
1. Who is in the sample data?
2. When is the data collected?
3. Where is sample data collected?
^ ==These are to make sure sample is representative!==
4. Why is the data collected?
5. What is in the Study?
6. How is data taken?

## Random Sampling
Only way to get unbiased sample data
### Simple random sampling
- Randomly pick one individual from entire population repeatedly until we get desired sample size
- Every individual has an equal chance of being picked
### Stratified random sampling
- Divide population into groups based on characteristics. Choose samples from each group using simple random sampling. ==Sample size of each group is proportional to group's size in entire population.==
### Cluster Sampling
- Divide population into groups randomly, *Not* by characteristics. Select a few groups randomly to be sample.

## Bias Avoidance
We must avoid the following to have representative data:
