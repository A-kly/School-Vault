# Statistics Process
## Descriptive Statistics
- Gathering data
- Summarize and present the data
	- *Summarize:* Mean, standard dev, median
	- *Present:* Histogram, graphs, tables
- Analyze and interpret the data
	- What does the data (median, mean, standard deviation, histogram) mean?
## Inferential statistics
- Make generalisations of the population

# Gathering data: Data types
## Categorical
- No granularity, only categories	
- Can be:
	- **Nominal**: No method to compare between categories, we have simply given *Names* to categories
		- Eg: Gender, Blood type
	- **Ordinal**: We can made an order to each category, One observation/category comes before (or is better than) another category
		- Eg: Letter grades
## Numerical
- No distinct categories, more continuous
- Eg:
	- Height
		- 190 cm, 190.1 cm, etc
	- Number of students in 151

## Figure out which
### Categorical vs Numerical
Ask: Does the data descibe a category or a value?
- Phone area code -> Category of location ->Categorical
### Nominal vs Ordinal
Ask: Is one data better than another?
- Phone area code -> Number is not ordered -> Nominal
