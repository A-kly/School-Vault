# Statistics Process
## Descriptive Statistics
- Gathering data
- Summarize and present the data
	- *Summarize:* Mean, standard dev, median
	- *Present:* Histogram, graphs, tables
- Analyze and interpret the data
	- What does the data (median, mean, standard deviation, histogram) mean?
## Inferential statistics
- Make generalisations of the population

# Gathering data: Data types
## Categorical
No granularity, only categories	
- **Nominal**: No method to compare between categories, we have simply given *Names* to categories
	- Eg: Gender, Blood type
- **Ordinal**: We can made an order to each category, One observation/category comes before (or is better than) another category
	- Eg: Letter grades

### Nominal vs Ordinal
Ask: Is one data better than another?
- Phone area code -> Number is not ordered -> Nominal
## Numerical
No distinct categories, more continuous
- **Discrete**: described with *integers* only
	- Counted, not measured
	- eg: \# of customers
- **Continuous**: Fractions of a unit are allowed
	- Measured, not counted
	- Eg: Height
## Categorical vs Numerical
Ask: Does the data descibe a category or a value?
- Phone area code -> Category of location ->Categorical
