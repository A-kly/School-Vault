- the integral of a function *u* and a derivative *dv* is **equal to** *u* times *v* from minus the integral of *v* times *du*
# How to:
![[Pasted image 20230509142348.png]]
1. Take our original integral and find a *u* and *dv* such that:
	1. The integral of *u * dv* is what I want to evaluate (is what were taking the integral of) AND
	2. The integral of **v * du** is simpler than the integral of *u * dv*
	3. To do this:
		1. List out all of the possible combinations of *u* and *dv* 
		2. The one that makes the right hand side (the integral of **v * du**) easier overall (calculate **du**)
	4. ==rule of thumb for *u* and *dv* choice:==
		1. "chose *dv* to be the most complicated part of the integrand such that you can integrate it mentally "

# An example of an incorrect choice:

If we choose the third combo of *u* and *dv* then we get an equation where the integral of **v * du** is more complicated.
