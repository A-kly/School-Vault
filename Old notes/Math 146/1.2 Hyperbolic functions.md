# Exponential function (e^x) gives rise to two hyperbolic functions
- cosh x = even section of e^x
- sinh x = odd section of e^x

- *Note*: Cosh is more concave than parabolic function (x^2)
	- cosine hyperbolic function: y = A + B cosh(x/B)
These can be used to get others, similar to trig:

- sech x : horizontal asymptote at y = 0
- csch x : vertical asymptote at x = 0

- The point on the hyperbola lies only on the right side because reasons.
