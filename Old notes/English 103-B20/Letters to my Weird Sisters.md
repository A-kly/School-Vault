What are the "views, beliefs and values" that guide Limburg's research?
What are the strengths and limitations of this methodology?

- Limburg does an excellent job and illustrating the importance of normality and non-exceptionalism in her work, she makes a point to not celebrate the weirdness of herself and others but rather to encourage the acceptance and appreciation for it.
- She desires to offer a personal perspective on the interaction between the general "normal" public and the "non-normal" autistic perspective. Her letters to these people are more of an active conversation about the shared experience of autism and Weirdness rather than a text, set in stone and unchangeable, which excludes others with similar experiences from the discussion.
